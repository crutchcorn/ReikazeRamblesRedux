2017 was a year of turmoil for both IRL and in Anime, but there was lots of great stuff to see, especially in regards to Anime. Welcome to The *AniTAY Anime Awards *of 2017, where AniTAY Authors and AniTAY members pick the best of the best Anime of the year!

The AniTAY Anime Awards is a collaborative effort by members in the AniTAY community to decide the best of the best of each year. We always try to put our own spin on these kinds of projects because when we see groups that don’t leverage different opinions, the results can radically differ from what the actual viewer think, and offer little choice. That’s why this Award process was open to the community and the decisions made were fascinating. We ran a poll both internally asking the authors of AniTAY as well as asking all the readers, so we have two sets of results. Here we go!

Here’s a bonus before we start -

#### **Author’s & Reader’s Pick for Best Non-Gendered Character: Phos (*Land of the Lustrious*)**

Phos really deserves a mention but kinda got snubbed due to the voting structure. Was one away from tying the best female in readers and was competitive for most! So, here’s your own category :3

## **Author Awards**

Here’s what the authors of AniTAY have to say! We here at AniTAY are an opinionated bunch, a group of people who vary drastically yet all magically have a consensus on certain things. We watch a lot of anime, so expect some different results than from most.
