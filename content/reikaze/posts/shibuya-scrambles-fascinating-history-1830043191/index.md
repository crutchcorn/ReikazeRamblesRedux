  magazine Famitsu, 428 has a unique and interesting history that starts before it came out that makes it what it is.
  428 bucks convention and trend to create the best possible visual novel story experience in nearly the best possible

  mini history lesson, we start by explaining Spike Chunsoft and Sound Novels as a whole: In the early 90s, Spike
  Chunsoft, which was known just as Chunsoft back then, created the very first Sound Novel, Otogirisou. Otogirisou was
  fairly different from the adventure games at the time thanks to Chunsoft’s decision to emphasize reading and music,
  hence the name Sound Novel<!-- --> .</p>

  popularized the genre in 1994, but not under the name sound novel - these games would be known here in the west as
  visual novels. That didn’t stop Chunsoft however: they continued to release their sound novels in this traditional
  manner that they originated, even as the rest of the Visual Novel industry moved on from the NVL(novel) to
  ADV(adventure) style, and didn’t really care much about the music<!-- --> .</p>

  cult classic and spiritual predecessor to <em>428</em>,<em> Machi</em>.<em> Machi</em>, which literally translates to
  City, used live actors and photographs to create a unique VN experience. With the NVL style, photographic presentation
  and parallel storytelling, <em>Machi</em> was incredibly unique and is a cult classic among Japanese gamers, being
  extremely well received. Back in 2006, Famitsu did a poll on JP gamers asking what they thought was the top 100 games
  of all time, Machi was 5. fans yearned for a sequel...</p>

Released on the Wii in 2009, 11 years after Machi, 428 is/was
  Machi on crack. Tripling the number of bad ends, filling the game <!-- -->to<!-- --> with a ton of machi references,
  and cranking up production values, 428 was a critical success and was the 9th game and only Visual Novel to hit a
  perfect score on Famitsu. Fun facts about 428 - The VN had a bonus chapter called Canaan written by Type-Moon’s Kinoko
  Nasu. Said bonus chapter actually got an anime, and my review for said anime is <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://rockmandash12.kinja.com/rockmandash-reviews-canaan-anime-1626371217",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://rockmandash12.kinja.com/rockmandash-reviews-canaan-anime-1626371217" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a></span>. If I ever get the time, I might update that review with a comparison of
  the VN chapter, but busy with <!-- -->school ;<!-- --> -;... Another fun fact, Director Jirou Ishii after 428 went on
  to be the producer for 999: Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors, and created the concept for the Under The Dog
  Kickstarter anime. <br/><br/>Thanks for joining me on this little tour through the Spike Chunsoft history that <!-- -->
  lead<!-- --> to 428! If you want thoughts on said VN, check out my review here, and let me know your thoughts on 428
  and this history article in the comments. Thank you very much. :)</p>
