  usually. This year, because 2016 has a habit of making everything bizarre, with this fall’s great shows being much
  more low key than the usual big hitters, It does have greats though, and here’s my list of them: Welcome to
  Rockmandash’s Top Anime of Fall 2016!<br/></p>

  on the Season Overall</h2>
<img alt src="./qtfok3nzxyuv3jyovrct.png"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Meh? After coming off of the fantastic winter and spring seasons of anime, one may
  get their hopes up for summer... but dreams remained dreams as they got meh. Like most people, in my opinion, the Fall
  2016 season of anime wasn’t all that great: while it had it’s greats (the top is STACKED) there were very few shows
  that compel you to watch every week. Basically this list was pretty much what I actually finished this season, as many
  shows compelled me to keep on watching. Disappointing, but everything has its ups and downs.<br/></p>
<hr class="gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw"/><h2 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h109878"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>Rules
</h2>
<img alt src="./djdsbz9mhyuvwkid92kt.png"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">My rules of this list are simple: if it aired/released this season, it can go on
  this list. I don’t see the point in only giving a show one chance during it’s airing season, and this is my list so
  I’ll list my favorite shows regardless of what season it started on. If this means that one show hogs the top spot for
  2 seasons, than good for that show! If it’s an OVA or movie that came out during the duration of the season I fell in
  love with, then it may be there. Also, I think that the seasonal split is arbitrary and unnecessary, so it’s
  completely gone here. Sorry about that, but that’s how I’m doing it.<br/></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Just an FYI,
  the placement of the show in the list is mostly based on my experience and enjoyment of the work, so if you’re
  wondering why something isn’t where you think it should be or you can’t really tell via the justification, that’s
  probably why. Keep in mind, just because a show is lower on the list doesn’t mean it’s bad - all of these are great,
  and a lower placement isn’t a mark against the show, at this point it’s nearly all personal preference.</p>

  Summary: </strong><em>Shelter</em> is a music video for the song “Shelter”, a collaborative effort of western artists
  Porter Robinson and Madeon. The story follows a 17 year-old girl named Rin who lives in a simulation. Each day she is
  able to create a world based on her imagination, and spends her time exploring her fantastical designs. Rin feels
  lonely because of a lack of human contact, but this all changes one day when the simulation taps into her repressed
  memories and reveals how she came to be in this world… - <em>Plot Summary from the </em><span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","http://anitay.kinja.com/the-17-anime-of-autumn-2016-you-should-be-watching-1789451240",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://anitay.kinja.com/the-17-anime-of-autumn-2016-you-should-be-watching-1789451240" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>17 Anime of Autumn 2016 You Should Be Watching Article</em></a></span> </p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Justification &amp; Thoughts:</strong> <em>Shelter </em>is a fantastic
  movie video/short, one that can elicit more emotions in 5 minutes than most 24 episode feelz anime can in their entire
  run. It’s a short done exceedingly well, a prime example of how one should do this kind of thing and I was blown away
  by it, as well as many others. The reason it’s HM (no, not because I don’t think it’s an anime) is that I have a hard
  time comparing a short like this to full sized anime and couldn’t really place it anywhere.</p>

  of getting a part time job at a local family diner. Though his new job isn’t physically as demanding as a 15km bike
  ride, Daisuke’s new job is mentally taxing due to his quirky co-workers. To add insult to injury, the information
  about the bankruptcy at his father’s business was all an elaborate ruse to get Daisuke to pay for his own amenities. -

</p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Justification &amp; Thoughts: </strong>I love the <em>Working! </em>series.
  It’s a great comedy show surrounding the Waganaria store, and while the main cast is gone from <em>WWW.Working!!</em>,
  the comedy is still here, as well as everything else that comes from this show. That is, being one of the most amusing
  and engaging comedy shows with wacky characters and wacky hijinks. I’d actually argue that I enjoyed
  <em>www.Working!! </em>even more than the original <em>Working!! </em>because of the new cast having a (personally)
  less frustrating dynamic than in the past. For some it can still get old, but for others, it’s definitely a fun time.

  Japanese figure skater Yuri Katsuki suffers a major defeat and embarrassment at the international Grand Prix Finale,

  inspired to shake up his own life and mentor his fan. With Viktor as his new coach, Yuri is challenged to find his
  own, bold style after a career of living cautiously. But to come out on top, he’ll have to face another Yuri - 15 year

</p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Justification &amp; Thoughts: </strong>Ah, <em>Yuri on Ice</em>. It’s a
  fantastic sports show, one that tells a moving story about the skater Yuri Katsuki’s efforts to fight back into
  prominence. It’s a brilliantly executed show that was a briliant watch every week thanks to fantastic skate scenes,
  absolutely brillant timing/pacing of events, well developed relationships (that are much more than Yaoi bait, trust
  me), and more. I particularly enjoyed the way it handled exposition and it’s OP/EDs were great too. That being said,
  the animation issues it had at times and the lackluster ending definitely knocked it down a peg for me. I still really
  enjoyed it, and it’s definitely one of the best of the year, but not AOTS/AOTY for me.</p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Justification &amp; Thoughts: </strong><em>WOAH. </em>I marathoned this one
  very recently after hearing members of AniTAY praise it to the moon, and even though I heasitated because Fantasy +
  Magical Girl aren’t really my cup of tea, what awaited me was some of the best animation of the year, some of the best
  storytelling you will find in anime, a cohesive experience that would constantly blow your mind, and an anime that can
  actually create a compelling mystery with fantastic twists. I just wish the last episode didn’t leave me like this:

</h2><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> I really love sports anime, and Haikyuu has been an integral part of my sports anime
  experience. Every episode being as hype as it could be with some of the best animation sequences you can think of,
  Haikyuu was a show to beat, one that would provide an amazing viewing experience as I watched it. This season was no
  exception, and I loved it to bits (even though I already knew what was gonna happen because I read the manga!
  yay).</p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Justification &amp; Thoughts: </strong>Girlish Number absolutely fantastic,
  the latest creation by <em>My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU</em>’s Author Wataru Watari<em> </em>but with a hint of
  <em>Shirobako </em>and Narcisism. It’s an absolutely amazing watch, noe that shows fascinating parts of an industry I
  love as well as being a wonderful character study that we would expect from Watari. Love it. <br/></p>
