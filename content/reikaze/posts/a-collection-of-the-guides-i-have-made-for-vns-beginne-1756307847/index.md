[Guide to Tablets for VNs](http://rockmandash12.kinja.com/rockmandashs-guide-to-tablets-for-vns-1753537859) - An extension to the VN on the Go guide, to recommend tablets for those looking to get one from a VN perspective.

[Top 10](http://rockmandash12.kinja.com/rockmandashs-top-10-favorite-visual-novels-1677663938) - My Top 10. Not necessarily a guide, but can be useful if looking for recommendations.
