Welcome to my Steins;Gate review! This time, I thought that there were enough differences to the Visual Novel and Anime that I would do a separate review of each. This article is here just for the purposes of linking to the reviews, and so I'm not spamming TAY.

If you want to read the reviews in the order I wrote them, read them VN first, and then anime first, but if you don't care, read the version you are more interested in.

I also am making a video review for the visual novel, should be coming out in a few days. Check out my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/pokestory1) for that.
