<div><img alt src="./ymsz5desnt8dxat6wahj.jpg"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Today, I have big news to announce for RockmanDash Reviews, one that will shake
  up the core of how content is produced here. It’s going to be a big change, but I hope you guys hang on for the ride.
  As the picture and header says, RockmanDash Reviews has a new home, and it might be closer than you think: I’m now a
  part of the Fuwanovel Reviews Team!</p>

  nearly 3 years since I started the RockmanDash Reviews Kinja blog, and almost 4 since I started doing reviews as a
  whole. As time has gone along, many things have changed: I have changed, the reviews I have written has changed, but
  most importantly, the community and industry as a whole has drastically changed... and because if these changes, the
  way that I need to do things in the past needs to change along with it.</p>

  was a middle school kid, doing exactly what a middle school kid would do: go to school and play video games. At the
  time, I was a part of a retro gaming forum called PGRF, and thanks to recommendations from some members, I got into

  favorite VN/Game) and that lead me to <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","http://rockmandash12.kinja.com/rockmandash-reviews-ever-17-the-out-of-infinity-vis-1626111485",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://rockmandash12.kinja.com/rockmandash-reviews-ever-17-the-out-of-infinity-vis-1626111485" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Ever 17: The Out of Infinity</em></a></span><em>. </em>These
  games impressed me in ways I wouldn’t have ever expected, becoming some of my favorite experiences I’ve ever had, but
  there was one thing that bothered me a lot, one thing that lead me into action... There was almost no discussion.
  Looking around the internet to see what people had to say about it, I would find literally a handful of articles or
  videos that were either extremely dated, or or extremely poor quality. There was no voice, there was no discussion
  about the things that I have experienced, that moved me in ways I have never seen before. This was something that
  changed my life, and all I could think after playing it (after the games blew my mind, of course) was that *<em>nobody
    is talking about it* </em>and *<em>I have to make a review of this, to get my voice out, a voice out*. </em> I
  promised myself that I would absolutely do something about this, spread the word about my new hobby and inform those
  who would come after me. <em>To make Visual Novels Popular in the West.</em><br/></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Fast
  foward to today: I’ve been semi-successful at my goal, with articles doing rather well (<span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","http://rockmandash12.kinja.com/the-beginners-guide-to-visual-novels-1541975662",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://rockmandash12.kinja.com/the-beginners-guide-to-visual-novels-1541975662" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">my guide hit over 100k views!)</a></span>, and I do reviews on games I really care about
  (See <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","http://rockmandash12.kinja.com/rockmandash-reviews-root-double-before-crime-after-1780907573",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://rockmandash12.kinja.com/rockmandash-reviews-root-double-before-crime-after-1780907573" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Root Double</em></a></span>), but with the growth and
  commercialization of the industry combined with others who do the same thing, it has come to my conclusion that I
  can’t do this alone anymore. At the moment I’m reliant on a service that could abandon me at any moment, by myself...
  even though the discussion of Visual Novels isn’t a lone voice screaming into the void anymore. I’ve been trying to
  play this game of community and my lack of production, leaving VNs I don’t have the capability to make a video version
  to others (I’ve tried not to overlap with <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://www.youtube.com/user/Ashadow700",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Ashadow700" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Ashadow Reviews</em></a></span><em>,</em>
  for an example), but there’s a better solution, and I’ve taken that now. I know some of the people on the team quite
  well, I share the same goal as them to help make VNs more popular, I’ve been on the FuwaReviews external reviews hub
  for the longest time and I’ve even guest reviewed for them so it only seemed to be the natural option. I’ve joined the
  FuwaReviews team, and my main RockmanDash Reviews will be on Fuwanovel from now on.</p>

<img alt src="./gic6e02anzr1jjh2vxza.png"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Now, for what this means for RockmanDash Reviews:<br/></p>
<ol class="sc-1lmbno3-1 sizyJ" data-style="Number" data-type="List">
<li>First off, my reviews will get more exposure: while they were getting views from the reviews hub, they were still
    external reviews and thus weren’t promoted. Now because I’m a part of the team, my words mean more, people actually
    care.
  </li>
<li>Next, this means that there will be more reviews from me: because I didn’t get review codes for everything in the
    past, I had to pay out of my hand for a lot of games. Fuwanovel is well known in the western Visual Novel Community,
    and because of that they can get review codes from virtually anyone.
  </li>
<li>3rd, this means if Kinja self destructs, I’m safe from that. This is good for the stability of RockmanDash
    Reviews, much better in the long term.
  </li>
<li>4th, My structure of review will change a bit to comply with Fuwanovel on that site. No hard breaks like on
    previous reviews, but it’s basically the same writing.
  </li>
<li>And last but not least, This doesn’t mean I’m stopping all writing on Kinja. I will still be a member of AniTAY,
    posting AniTAY reviews and articles there. I will still write my thoughts on things that aren’t necessarily reviews.
    My reviews will still be posted here, these things aren’t changing, and they really shouldn’t. (As a side note, if I
    ever get the time and energy to make a video review, I’ll be able to do that still, and those will be on my YouTube
    channel as well.)
  </li>
</ol>

  there. At the beginning I will release the kinja versions late, becuase I want to promote the Fuwanovel version so
  there will be links to it, but I don’t want to abandon Rockmandash Reviews and it’ll get back to normal eventually. I
  apologize for the inconvenience, and I hope you continue on the ride.<br/></p>
