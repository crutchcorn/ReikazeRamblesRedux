The end of the year always causes reminiscing, where we try to define the time spent. As a result, top lists and awards quickly arise, and here at AniTAY, we are not immune. So, when we saw that others were doing Anime Awards in the style of The Game Awards, we thought we’d do it with our own spin. Welcome to The *AniTAY Anime Awards* of 2016!

The AniTAY Anime Awards is a collaborative effort by members in the AniTAY community to decide the best of the best of this year. However we always try to put our own spin on these kinds of projects because when we see groups that don’t leverage different opinions, the results can radically differ from what the actual viewer think, and offer little choice. That’s why this Award process is open to you!

This article will cover the nominations selected by AniTAY members mucking around on a Google Docs sheet. While what we got here is pretty good, AniTAY is a community, and we can’t do this without everyone’s help! If you see anything missing or have any suggestions (outside of the OP/ED category, editing that is an effort in futility, and we’re probably going to make a separate collab for that) [fill out this form](https://goo.gl/forms/vkQpnunBrOHtReiz1) and I’ll try to take suggestions and add it to the list. Suggestions will be closed on 1/2/2017.

As a community effort, We will also let everyone have a voice in the awards as well. We’ll be doing this by having 2 awards, the Author’s Awards and the Reader’s Awards! This way we can keep our voice while including everyone in the process! Make your vote count by [filling this form here](https://goo.gl/forms/eNBI7yvgsD9EzHXS2). Voting will be closed 1/9/2017, when we release the results in it’s own separate article.

Anyways, enough about the Awards, you’re here to see what we think: Here are the nominees! (Note: It has been decided to push *Your Name* until next year’s awards so more people can have the opportunity to watch the film, so it will not be nominated here.)
