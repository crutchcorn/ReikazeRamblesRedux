</h2><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">The many worlds interpretation is one of the basic concepts of quantum physics.
  Pretty much what it says is this: whenever a decision is made, the universe branches into two, and all of the worlds
  are real. the points that change the world is called a singularity.</p>
<h2 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h118254"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>What does this mean for RPGs?
</h2><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">I believe there are 2 singularity points in an RPG, where the path you take can
  influence the world of the RPG: Story changes, and save points. The first one is the most similar to the adventure
  games, where you have to make a decision in the plot in the story. Every decision makes a different world. An example
  would be WRPGs like Mass effect. </p>

<img alt src="./672595760904096545.jpg"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">The second type isn't as obvious, and I like to call it the Save point singularity point.
  What is a save point? When you look at it in a gameplay perspective, you might just call me crazy. It's made for you
  to save your place, in case of a boss battle, or so you can come back. Think of it in a story perspective though. A
  Save Point, is an important point in an RPG. </p>

<img alt src="./672595761021978145.jpg"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">They usually put these right before a boss,or some other important decision. When you think
  of it in that way, it's very similar to adventure games and Visual novel games, but instead of actually determining
  with a choice, you determine it with actions. Every time you lose against a boss, that's one world, and the people of
  that world has to live with that decision. Most games just flash a game over screen and brings you back to your
  choice, but some do show the consequences of failing, like in Chrono Trigger, every time you get a game over, it shows
  Lavos destroying the world. It gives a scope of your actions, and it shows what happens if you do fuck up. I think it
  changes the whole perspective of the game, and it gives it that extra push from great to absolutely fantastic.</p>

<img alt src="./672595761261233185.jpg"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Every time you come back to a save, think of it as another world in the many parallel
  worlds going on. Think of your experience as the cherry picked worlds, as obviously your death doesn't affect the
  story. Game Devs, if you are listening, give this a shot! Have it so it sticks to one world line, and where when you
  die, you just shift to another character and the world has to live with your consequences of the hero dying. I'd be
  great.</p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">I hope you enjoyed this post, and next time, think about this when you are playing
  through some RPG, It could change your whole viewpoint of the game.</p>
