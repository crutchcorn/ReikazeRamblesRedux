Every now and then, we go and play some random game on the AniTAY Games chatroom, and then spend some time randomly talking via skype call. Today, Dexomega decided he'd "explain" the wonders that is *Da Capo*, and it's a pretty hilarious listen. Sorry for the clicking and the fact that my voice is way louder than everyone else, that's how my background skype recorder works and editing it a lot would be kinda silly given how casual the situation is. May transcribe it or actually edit it in the future, but that would require work....
