It’s almost a comforting clockwork - we go through the year watching great anime, and then when we creep up ever closer to the end of our calendars, we spend our time reflecting back on the brightest moments for anime. Welcome to our annual *AniTAY Anime Awards*, a collaborative effort by members in the AniTAY community to decide the best of the best!

AniTAY, now more than ever is community first, and we always try to put our own community spin on these kinds of projects because the different opinions fed by the diversity of the community leads to better results. That’s why this Award process is open to everyone!

This article will cover the nominations selected by AniTAY members mucking around on a Google Docs sheet. While what we got here is pretty good, we can’t do this without everyone’s help! If you see anything missing or have any suggestions [fill out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfEo_bHWEeyDGhqF77cRrSCOVlwgiDrPfsghJ_8vEprbjMCyg/viewform?usp=sf_link) or post comments on the sheet and I’ll try to take suggestions and add it to the list. Suggestions will be closed on 12/30/2019.

Like always, we’ll be running 2 awards, the Author’s Awards and the Reader’s Awards. This way we can keep our voice while including everyone in the process. Make your vote count by [filling this form here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeYCb-Ftzj8gEueZzzXbGAq69rg9x5DB7qMl7aNv0k07FkCNA/viewform?usp=sf_link). Voting will be closed 1/13/2020, when we release the results in a separate article.

This year, we added a sequel category, which we felt was necessary given the number of shows that are sequels. Hope you enjoy the tweaks and look forward to seeing your votes! Enough of my rambling, onto the nominees!
