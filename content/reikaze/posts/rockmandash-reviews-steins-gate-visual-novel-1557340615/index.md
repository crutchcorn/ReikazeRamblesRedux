  Steins;Gate is a visual novel made which was a cooperative project by 5pb and Nitroplus.

  Visual Novel <strong>about</strong> <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">time travel</a></span>. The key
  word here is <strong>about</strong>, as a lot of series use time travel, but they almost never go over how it works.
  How time travel works is the main premise of Steins;Gate, and it even has references to real theories, real groups,
  and real people. The rules of time travel might be <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FictionalFieldOfScience",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FictionalFieldOfScience" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pseudoscience</a></span>, but
  Steins;Gate sticks with these rules and makes it feel like a real thing. The plot was structured very well, almost
  like it was meticulously hand-crafted like a luxurious item. One thing that might bother some people is the pacing,
  which starts out slow. I don't believe the slow pace at the beginning holds back the writing at all, as that time is
  used well to develop the characters and make this game very enjoyable when they eventually punch your gut in chapter
  5.Even if you didn't think the beginning was slow, definitely picks up. Once it picks up, you need to be prepared for
  one of the best experiences you will have ever experienced, with outstanding character development, unique scenarios
  because of this time travel plot, and an atmosphere that will blow your mind. It's an intellectual roller coaster, and
  it's a fun one.</p>
<img alt src="./1136959573104064658.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Steins;Gate follows the Future Gadget Lab and their adventures with time travel. By
  complete accident, the lab manages to send a email back in time, and the future gadget lab learns to use time travel…
  with massive consequences (IE <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButterflyOfDoom",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButterflyOfDoom" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Butterfly Effect</a></span>). One
  thing that Steins;Gate nailed with the writing, is the balance between humor and seriousness, which is one thing a lot
  of shows don't really get. Out of all the amazing characters in this game, the protagonist Okabe Rintarou aka <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hououin Kyouma</a></span>
  steals the show. Okabe's <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrImagination?from=Main.Chuunibyou",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrImagination?from=Main.Chuunibyou" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">chuunibyou</a></span> habit is grating at

  ever.

  favorite out there.and Shiina Mayuri, our <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">airhead cosplayer</a></span>, is a relief
  character, but has a surprising amount of depth. I could go on and on about the characters, as they are all great. The
  same thing could be said about the writing in general about this game: it's great and I could go on and on about it.
  That's just how good it is.</p><h4 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h118559"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>Writing

<img alt src="./1136959573130060946.jpg"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">The gameplay is played pretty straight, but it might throw you off as it does
change some things. Like every other visual novel, you make choices and you read a lot, but gone are the flowchart-y
gameplay that most visual novels are, this is a very linear visual novel and the choices you make do not change the
plot entirely, they change what endings you get. Also, the way you make the decisions is also slightly different in
Steins;Gate. In Steins;Gate they have this phone trigger system where whenever you get a message or a call, you have
to choose things and depending on your choices within this phone trigger system, things will change. The Phone Trigger
system is very subtle, and is a very nice and unique way of interacting with the game. Steins;Gate has many small
changes that make it unique, and after playing though so many visual novels that have little to no change in the
gameplay department, it's a nice change of pace.</p>

<img alt src="./1136959573146245778.jpg"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> Horray for 16:9! This is one of the nicest looking Visual Novels I've ever
played, and being in 16:9 is something that really makes my day, as when I play in full screen, it actually like like
it's supposed to. About the visuals of the game itself, Steins;Gate has this nice <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignStudentsOrgasm",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignStudentsOrgasm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">water colored, pixelated style</a></span>
to it, and it really makes it quite unique. They way they use it in promo art and even random parts in the game help
set it from other visual novels and it keeps your eyes open. It's a very aesthetically pleasing game. Everything is
pleasing to the eye, from random items in the game like the Oopa's, to the character designs, and the
backgrounds.There aren't a lot of visual novels that can compare to the charm and aesthetics this game has with its
unique style.</p>

I thought that they did a great job at picking
  the cast for the voice-over, as they did an amazing job with the characters and it helps make the experience better.
  I'll never be able to think of Mayuri without thinking of the excellent Tuturu the voice actor did. On a side note,
  the voices are the same as the Japanese version of the anime, but they sound different. It's a pretty easy transition
  for the most part but if you're used to one of them it might be a little jarring. As for the soundtrack, I liked it
  for the most part, as the music was pretty decent. Most of the music was pretty good, and there are some stellar songs
  in the game, but I wish that the music was used a bit better. Some of the usage of the soundtrack isn't the greatest,
  and it could be improved. One little thing I enjoyed about the soundtrack was the ringtones that they have in the
  game, I have it set as my ringtone on my phone, and it's a pretty decent ringtone. Steins;Gate has some good tracks,
  but it does have it's forgettable parts too.</p>

<img alt src="./1136959573187096722.png"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> I love Steins;Gate. If I didn't I wouldn't be making 2 simultaneously released
reviews right? I think with the charm of the characters, and the best usage of time travel just steal the show with
me. I love how Steins;Gate spends so much of it's time showing all the consequences of time travel, which isn't
something you see that often. While the game and anime are remarkably similar, they are a very different experience.
They have minor differences, but I feel like the way most of it is executed in the game has more impact, an example
would be the final scene with the credits. I feel that the Visual novel is a better experience overall, as it's more
immerse, more unique, and has more content overall. If I was going to recommend a version, I'd recommend the Visual
Novel. Because I played through the fan translation, some of the official translation choices confused me. The
changing of Ruka's name to Luka is stupid (I understand why, Japanese doesn't make a difference between R &amp; L, but
all the other versions spell it Ruka :|), this is just nitpicking though and it shouldn't hinder your experience. The
strong points of Steins;Gate overall though is that the story is relatable, it has a great concept and it's executed
very well. What else is there to ask? This is the formula for a great experience.</p>

<h4 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h118563"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>Enjoyment - 10/10</h4>
<img alt src="./xqv11t1oyhswmfpvefwc.png"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> Steins;Gate is an experience that nobody should miss. This is an amazing game that
  covers all the nitty gritty about time travel - something that other shows and games in the past were always too
  afraid to cover. With a great concept, and great execution, this is a no-brainer. This is one of the
  <strong>BEST</strong> experiences I've ever had in any medium ever, and I'm sure it will be just as amazing for you.
</p><h2 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h118564"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>I give this a Rockmandash
  Remarkable, and a 9.75/10 overall.</h2>
