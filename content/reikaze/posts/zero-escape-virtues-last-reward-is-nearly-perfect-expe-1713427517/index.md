<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">When you have to trust others with your life on the line, everything is
  fundamentally different. While <em>999</em> put the character’s life on the line in a situation that pushed them to
  the absolute limits, <em>Zero Escape: Virtue’s Last Reward </em>turns the Extreme Escape concept around by basing the
  setting of the game on a modified version of the Prisoner’s Dilemma, which brings in new and fresh psychological
  aspects while maintaining the themes and quality that made <em>999</em> great. It’s pretty much the best way they
  could have succeeded<em> 999</em>, and they did it pretty well.</p>
<img alt src="1332363778882116528.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">We follow Sigma, a college student who is kidnapped and sent to an abandoned
  warehouse to play the <em>Nonary Game: Ambidex Edition</em>, which relies on the Bracelet Point (BP) system, in which
  you have to go through the Ambidex game in which you vote ally or betray until you get 9 points to go through the 9
  door to freedom. The thing is, during the Ambidex game...</p>
<ul class="sc-1lmbno3-0 dpuHif" data-style="Bullet" data-type="List">
<li>If you both ally, you both get two points.</li>
<li>If you ally and your partner betrays, you lose two points and they get three.</li>
<li>If you betray and your partner allies, you get three points and they lose two.</li>
<li>If you both betray, you both get nothing.</li>
</ul>
<img alt src="1332363778957118896.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Due to these systems, <em>Zero Escape: Virtue’s Last Reward </em> is able to bring
  the most of human desperation and trust, analyzing what it truly means to trust others, dealing with what it even
  means to be a human and the essence of the relationship between two beings. While 999 mainly covered the intensity of
  life and death and how it relates to the individual, <em>Zero Escape: Virtue’s Last Reward</em> strikes hard on the
  social aspects, running wild with pretty much anything that it possibly can and in this aspect, VLR is an amazing
  sequel, creating a moving story that handles all these interesting elements, moving you with the plot in ways that
  many stories just cannot. Plus, the concepts themselves are pretty great, from Shrodinger’s cat, the Many-Worlds
  interpretation, Asimov’s 3 Laws of Robotics, the Turning Test, 4th Dimensional Beings (<span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","http://rockmandash12.kinja.com/rockmandash-reviews-ever-17-the-out-of-infinity-vis-1626111485",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://rockmandash12.kinja.com/rockmandash-reviews-ever-17-the-out-of-infinity-vis-1626111485" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">again</a></span>) and the Chinese room, these are all used extremely well, and are a core
  aspect to the story that makes Zero Escape one of the best out there. (Plus, <strong>I ACTUALLY KNOW SOME OF THESE
    WITH CONTEXT OUTSIDE OF THE GAME! ^.^</strong>)</p>
<img alt src="1332363779032513200.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">These concepts just shows the strengths of the Zero Escape series, with a great
  premise, extremely well executed characters and their interactions (all were pretty great, but notable is Zero III...
  how can you say no?), nearly it has nearly perfect pacing throughout the story, executed in a way that keeps you
  hooked and engaged throughout, with foreshadowing and a level of mystery that keeps you going in ways that other games
  simply cannot. Add to the fact that this series never fails to create an amazing atmosphere that only improves
  immersion in almost every way, has witty and interesting writing throughout, with plot twists and brilliant endings
  (there’s 24 of them!) that will blow your mind, supplanting this series as one of the best you’ve seen, a series of
  games that never fails to be amazing, one never fails to be some of the best stories you have ever read. It does
  everything you’d want a story to do, and they do it extremely well.</p>
<img alt src="1332363779090704816.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">That being said, one of the Zero Escape series’s strongest assets have been toned
  down in <em>Zero Escape: Virtue’s Last Reward </em>and that is what I called <em>999</em>’s biggest differentiator:
  <strong>Tension</strong>, my favorite aspect of <em>999</em>. An Abandoned warehouse just doesn’t provide the same
  ring and tension as <strong>SINKING CRUISELINER</strong>, right? In <em>VLR</em>, there is a lack of an immanent
  source of death always looming upon you, and due to this, it lessens the tension that made 999 my favorite work out
  there, and the feel of the work just doesn’t feel as tight, as adrenaline pumping, and as exciting, with the
  atmosphere being much more mellow in comparison. While the game brings back the tension in the later half of the game,
  and makes up for it in spades at parts with it’s well done mystery, VLR isn’t about pushing you to the limits, and to
  me it takes layer of immersion out that really shouldn’t have been messed with.</p>
<img alt src="1332363779145660848.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">While one may debate that it’s not necessarily a bad change and some may even debate
  that the game is significantly better for it, there’s no disputing that <em>Zero Escape: Virtue’s Last Reward </em>is
  a fundamentally different work, being less of a thriller, but being more of a mystery, and much more calm in the
  process. While it’s one of the best mysteries I’ve ever played, getting you to think about every little thing even
  though there’s no way you could figure it out, making the game very engaging and entertaining, this change is still
  something I personally dislike, as there’s nothing I love more in a good story than a good thriller, which this one
  lacks for a large chunk of the game. This is pretty sad in my opinion, especially because this is pretty much due to
  meddling from upper management because the people polled in the Japanese market said they didn’t buy it because of the
  tension, so they lessened in<em> VLR</em>. My message to you, Spike Chunsoft? Let this man write his story, he knows
  what he’s doing.</p>
<img alt src="1332363779251583152.png"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Also, there’s another pretty debatable issue with the writing, one that would have
  ruined the game if <em>Zero Escape 3</em> never came: <strong>The Ending</strong>. <em>Virtue’s Last Reward</em>
  doesn’t really end so much as it leaves you in to jump to <em>ZE3</em>, but not really doing anything about resolving
  the story it has, which pretty much dooms <em>VLR</em> to be the middle runt of the series forever. I mean, in context
  with <em>ZE3</em>, it works really well, but there’s the issue that <em>ZE3</em> isn’t out yet, and <em>VLR </em>doesn’t
  have a “good” end: it has an ending that can lead to hope, but is one that is ultimately facing disaster. The
  characters are dealing with the loss of a promised life, the loss of everything, and the world is still dealing with
  an apocalyptic situation. To top it all off, we have no idea what’s going to happen to our main characters, being sent
  to the past. There needed to be a third game, and<em> VLR</em> is waiting for it’s Reward, the <em>ZE3</em> that it
  deserves. Now that we have it, this isn’t such a big deal, but it’s still a mark against the game, considering there
  was a chance that we wouldn’t be able to get it.</p>

<hr class="gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw"/>
<img alt src="1332363779397203120.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Like it’s predecessor, VLR is one of the few visual novels that actually have real
  gameplay, and this comes in the form of puzzle sections, the rooms where you need to find the way out to progress the
  story. That being said, what VLR does with the gameplay in comparison to <em>999</em> though, is make it fundamentally
  better in almost every way, making the work that much more enjoyable. While many times gameplay can inhibit your
  experience with the story, this is pretty much never the case, where the gameplay supports elements of the story,
  making this an amazing experience. </p>
<img alt src="1332363779540843696.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Think of ANY issues you had with the gameplay of<em> 999</em> (other than the fact
  that it’s a<span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","http://rockmandash12.kinja.com/the-beginners-guide-to-visual-novels-1541975662",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://rockmandash12.kinja.com/the-beginners-guide-to-visual-novels-1541975662" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> visual novel</a></span>, you can’t really get away from
  that), and its been fixed here. Tired of not being able to skip through parts you already read? Not an issue here as
  the skip function is super fast and super flexible. Want to just jump around to the part you need, and not have to
  deal with re-reading parts you have already read? Well, VLR has the answer to that question, implemented in a way that
  makes me wish every VN had it: <strong>THE MOST AWESOME FLOWCHART IN EXISTANCE!!!!! </strong>You can jump to pretty
  much anywhere you want, you can see the progress in the story, and it’s even integrated into the story in a way that
  no other element of gameplay for A VN can really do. Being able to jump and use the information learned to proceed is
  the coolest thing ever, and it makes a multi-route VN much easier to bear. Also, with a flowchart, you know all the
  possibilities that you can try, making proceeding much less of a random guess like<em> 999</em>, but something you can
  actually manage. Really, I adore the flowchart, and it’s absolutely fantastic. Plus, the puzzles are pretty great too!
  :P</p>
<img alt src="1332363779748651952.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">One big thing I do need to mention though is that it’s probably safer to go with the
  vita version because in the 3DS version of the game, there’s a big save glitch that’ll corrupt your save if you save
  in the Golem room or in the Decompression room, but there have been cases where people lost data in other rooms, so
  it’s best to just put your 3DS in hibernation mode when in a puzzle mode and just save during the novel sections. I
  played through the 3DS version and was perfectly fine, but it’s best to play it safe and it’s something you need to be
  aware of when you play the game.<br/></p>

<img alt src="1332363779898694576.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">I don’t really have a strong opinion about the Visuals, and there’s not much to say:
  they pretty much do the job, but that’s about it. The visuals of<em> VLR </em> are pretty nice, but they aren’t the
  best out there, even for the respective consoles. Unlike<em> 999 </em>which looked like an old adventure game, <em>Virtue’s
    Last Reward </em>made all the characters into 3D models and modernized the aesthetic in comparison, with a more
  cohesive design in general. That being said, I have no real preference between them because while VLR is better
  technically, I think it looses some of the charm that <em>999</em> had going with it’s aesthetic so it’s pretty much a
  draw overall.</p>
<img alt src="1332363779988372400.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">The art is pretty solid though and some may consider it an improvement: while I
  prefer sprites, the 3D models are much more flexible, are better animated, show the emotions of the characters just as
  well and is just more cohesive artwork in general. Also, the visuals are pretty much the same when you compare the two
  versions, with the main difference being resolution, and the fact that the 3DS has two screens, so visuals shouldn’t
  be your deciding reason for platform choice.</p>

  atmospheric soundtracks that are available in gaming as it does a great job capturing the essence of the work and
  effectively using it’s sound to manipulate you as a player? It’s back in full force, as Shinji Hosoe from<em> 999</em>
  composed the soundtrack here once again, and it’s great. </p>
<div class="ooo3c9-0 PpIMM align--bleed has-video media-large video-embed embed-frame"><span class="flex-video widescreen"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cys1-jwTQnY" width="560"></iframe><span class="js_recommend" data-chomp-id="Cys1-jwTQnY" data-recommend-id="youtube://Cys1-jwTQnY" data-recommended="false" id="youtube-Cys1-jwTQnY"></span></span></div><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">It does everything that <em>999</em> did well, manipulating your mood, creating a great
  atmosphere, amplifying your feelings, sounding great in general, the whole gamut of actions that a good soundtrack
  does. Where this soundtrack looses marks is the fact that this is literally<em> 999</em>’s soundtrack, just
  remastered... yup, almost every track in here is a remix of <em>999</em>’s soundtrack, made to sound grander, with
  some even having orchestral elements. If you asked me to compare, I couldn’t really give you a clear answer: I really
  appreciated the simplicity of the original soundtrack, and what they did stylistically, but ZE:VLR’s sounds just as
  good, even if it looses a bit stylistically. It does loose points for not being original though, and that’s kinda a
  disappointment.</p>
<div class="ooo3c9-0 PpIMM align--bleed has-video media-large video-embed embed-frame"><span class="flex-video widescreen"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b22btwlVVow" width="560"></iframe><span class="js_recommend" data-chomp-id="b22btwlVVow" data-recommend-id="youtube://b22btwlVVow" data-recommended="false" id="youtube-b22btwlVVow"></span></span></div><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">That being said, the new addition to the soundtrack is pretty great: <em>Blue Bird
  Lamentation</em> is pretty much the only new track, but it’s done so well that I can’t help but adore it. It’s VLR’s
  Morphogenetic Sorrow, the feelz song that is super powerful with it’s simple yet awesome music box playing with the
  beautiful orchestral sound, and it’s pretty much the best of both worlds when it comes to these soundtracks. It’s a
  great track, and I’m a big fan.</p>

<img alt src="./1332363780095563440.jpg"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Also, this game has full voice acting, and the North American localization even has a dual
audio option. During my first playthrough at launch, I played through the English voice acting and during my second
playthrough for review, I tried the Japanese voice acting. While I prefer the English voice acting because I’m more
familiar with it overall, the Japanese dub is just as great and it really is up to personal preference. Plus, you can
change the language really easily as it prompts you every time you go load up the save... pretty awesome. </p>

  I’d say that VLR does enough differently to make it a fresh and great game, and as long as you’re enjoying it, why
  does it matter? </p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">This is a game that thrives on your experience, hooking the player me like no other
  series can really do, and it did this with a compelling story, writing that makes you connect with the characters,
  writing that engages you with the work, writing that is both interesting, entertaining, and amazing. While the tension
  I adored from <em>999</em> has been lessened, it makes up for it with other elements like mystery and the interesting
  SciFi, and because of that it’s just as great of an experience. While I may prefer 999 because there are elements I
  like in that game more, that is in no way a knock on VLR, it’s just a personal preference and VLR is pretty great as
  well, one of the best games I have played in my life. </p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><em>Zero Escape: Virtue’s Last Reward</em> is a game does a lot extremely well, with
  a gripping narrative that you’ll probably love that strikes at the essence of human interaction, characters that are
  outstanding, and an experience that can be beat by few. It’s only when you’re comparing it to it’s predecessor that it
  gets messy, with 999 edging it out. That being said, 999 is a hard feat to follow, and VLR did it in nearly the best
  way possible, so why look negatively at it? It’s a great game that I adore, and one I hope you do too.</p>
