<div><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">When I write a review, I typically do so because I want to talk about it, and get my
  thoughts out about it. This works out well when I go into a work knowing that I want to review it, but there are times
  when trying to review and analyze something can lessen the experience, like killing a backlog. Today on Rockmandash
  Reviews, I'm trying a new article structure to see if I can bridge this gap, with the<em><strong> SUPER DELUXE ANIME

  Gauntlet serves multiple purposes. First off, I've heard a lot of complaints that we really don't cover older shows
  here on AniTAY. This is a completely valid complaint because... we don't. It just so happens that most of my backlog
  are older shows (not this time in particular, but in the future there will be more older shows) and are the ones that
  have been recommended with near universal praise, so it kinda works out. Second, I don't really have the time to do
  full reviews for everything I see, but even when I don't, I still want to talk about them. This is my way of
  compromising on that: it's shorter reviews in the style of my lists but in more detail or Dex's<span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://anitay.kinja.com/dex-reviews-space-yuri-school-and-more-1676056274",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://anitay.kinja.com/dex-reviews-space-yuri-school-and-more-1676056274" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Purgatory reviews </a></span>(which I may have a Gauntlet dedicated to). Third, In my
  opinion, this season is relatively dry, so I'm working on trying to slay the beast that is a backlog, and this is the
  best way I thought of to cover these shows in my backlog. Now that I've said all of that, it's time to get into the
  gauntlet! (Note: The order of this is the order I watched it, there's no rhyme or reason to it.)</p>

</aside><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Thoughts: </strong>It's an interesting, realistic disaster show that is
  something that everyone should watch. I pretty much agree with Dex on most aspects, as it's an amazing coming of age
  story with an awesome, powerful narrative, and a great feeling of tension, especially in the second half. What really
  got me into it was how realistic it felt, how it gets you to know these characters like you knew them in real life,
  and how it felt like you were actually in the situation. The mystery felt real, the situation in general felt real,
  and it's just fantastic. The impact that the show has on you is just amazing: It's a coming of age done in a
  fantastic, realistic way, and it will evoke feelings from you. I really mean that: I don't think I've cried this much
  while watching a show since White Album 2, and it just blew my mind. I had a great time watching through this show,
  even though it was a bit depressing.<br/></p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Thoughts:</strong> The <em>Time of Eve </em>is a great and realistic near
  sci-fi that felt believable, something I really appreciate. I really enjoyed it, but I wish they had more time to
  flesh the characters out, as the way that it's done here leaves room for improvement. The best part of the show has to
  be the society and the world: the way that the show expanded on how society viewed human/robot interactions, the look
  on the social structure, and just seeing the characters act in the way that they did was pretty interesting and
  engaging, especially at the Time of Eve cafe. The premise is based around the human/robot relationships, and they
  executed everything about that extremely well with interesting scenarios throughout the show/movie. Also, due to the
  way that the characters interact and the way it presents the story, the show gets you to think, even if you've seen
  these themes and have been asked these questions tons of times already. What is a human? What is a Robot? Which is
  which, and does it even matter? How would you treat a robot if they were nearly humanoid, and how does that reflect
  your treatment twords humans? It's a pretty deep show/movie, especially considering the time it has to work with.</p>
<img alt src="./rs1spphiounoo6qfgsnr.png"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">The show is focused on the character interactions and the dynamics of people and
  robots who don't know which is which, and delving into these relationships was deeply interesting, but the most
  important relationship wasn't fleshed out at all, to my dismay. It lacks in the very same thing that I praised Patema
  inverted for: Catharsis. I really wanted to see Rikuo and Sammy get to know each other better, and how their
  relationship changed after all the events happened, but they didn't go into it at all. They developed pretty much
  everyone else in a great way, but that one relationship wasn't touched at at all, which left me disappointed with the
  overall story.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">As for the presentation, it was pretty good. The tone of the show is
  what really dictates it all: It's a pretty mellow show at most times due to its premise of being about a cafe and its
  always calming and relaxed, but it manages to handle it's serious ideas well. It creates an atmosphere that is
  interesting, calming and relaxed yet very real. The visuals were beautiful, with great lighting that made it all
  happen while looking just great in general. I have a minor complaint with it though, as the characters looked kinda
  plain, but that sorta helped the story with its trying to be real, so it's not really a big deal. The soundtrack was
  good, did the job and helped scenes when it needed to, and sounded nice but didn't really stick out.</p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Overall, I liked <em>Time of Eve.</em> I ended up a bit disappointed with it due to
  some things... but it's pretty good in general, with a great world and awesome atmosphere. For more thoughts, check

  in a town full of Japanese businessmen. His normal day consists of social drinking with clients and being kicked
  around by his bosses. He finally gets a break though, as he's sent by his company to the tropical seas of Eastern
  China to deliver a disc. But his boat gets hijacked by a band of mercenaries hired to retrieve the disc. Rock (as he
  is newly dubbed by his captors) catches the interest of the only female merc Revy as she thinks he's worth a ransom,
  taking him hostage. However, the disc that was stolen has a terrible secret that's unknown to Rock, which causes
  massive confusion and chaos for both him and his kidnappers. <em>- Plot Description from MAL</em></p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Why I watched it: </strong>I watched this mainly because I was interested in
  how they portrayed Southeast Asia (I'm Vietnamese and have been there several times). Also, I've heard about this show
  quite a bit, and have had some recommendations so I gave it a spin.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">
<strong>Thoughts: </strong>Guns, Girls, and Gangs. These are 3 words that can pretty much describe the show and
  everything about it. It's an over the top action show that takes place in an interesting part of the world and oozes
  enjoyment (Torpedo + Plane = Boom). Personally? Not my type of show, but I can totally see why people would love it.
  It's very well done, well rounded, and well developed. The characters and setting are great, and the scenarios they
  get in are extremely engaging. Also, Baddass action fights. What's not to love? It's an episodic action adventure
  that's always interesting. </p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Surprisingly, I really enjoyed the writing of this show, as it was pretty well
  executed. All the characters are great: well developed, interesting and entertaining. I was surprised how much I liked
  Rock as he was a great main who got a surprising amount of development (I found his nickname funny because people call
  me "Rock" online cus of my username) and even the bad guys got a decent amount of development. The world is just as
  awesome, taking place in Southeast Asia and representing it's city of Roanniper pretty well. It's good writing and
  good action makes for the best type of action show, where the writing supports the action but never gets in the
  way.</p>
<img alt src="./1083258962581174312.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">As for the presentation, it really hasn't aged at all. The visuals look great,
  especially when you consider that it's 10 years old, and it sounds pretty solid as well. About the soumd, pretty good
  but the ED SUCKSSSSSSSSSSSSSssssssssssss. Also, listen to the dub. You are doing yourself a disfavor if you listen to
  the sub. </p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">To those interested in my viewpoint and how it relates to "dark" shows,
  because that's where I was originally asked about this, I'd say this is a show that has elements of it and uses it
  pretty well, but it isn't the primary focus on it. It's used to build the world and characters, and the show
  definitely goes through those darker aspects of life, but it's all about the action. Due to me watching it for the
  plot and world first, action second, it got me thinking about life, how they live in a totally different world. People
  who spend time watching this show will never be able to do things like them, and they just live in a totally different
  world, one I'd never be able to endure. I really admired Rock as he managed to bridge the two worlds together, even
  though he was kinda avoiding both of them...</p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Overall, Black Lagoon is pretty great. It's the best type of action show that you
  can find, with great writing and great action. It's a great ride, and if you are looking for some fun action, here it
  is. </p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Score: </strong>8/10, Polarization +1.5, -1. <strong><em>Rockmandash

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Thoughts: </strong>If you are watching Death Parade, it's pretty much the
  same thing, and pretty similar to the first episode in particular. (Makes sense though, it's essentially a pitch
  version) There was pretty much no real explanation, it was just 2 guys told to play a game of billiards for their
  lives, and it was great. I really liked the characters in it: the old man was fantastic, entertaining and quick-minded
  while the other guy was School Days'd :P, and both of them were very entertaining, with an awesome rant at the end.
  The OVA in general was just pretty good: it had interesting back stories, an interesting premise, a great atmosphere,
  is absolutely beautiful when it comes to visuals, and it was very entertaining. It's well done, as expected from
  Madhouse, and it's pretty good.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Score: </strong>8/10, Polarization: +1.5, -1.

  afraid of mindfuck, but if everything is like that, I'm going to marathon through all of his movies this week!
  Seriously, <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://anitay.kinja.com/some-rambling-about-serial-experiments-lain-1663388188",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://anitay.kinja.com/some-rambling-about-serial-experiments-lain-1663388188" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">think Lain</a></span> but better, as this has all the
  same core themes of an identity crisis and delusions, but this time wrapped up in a thriller package. I love
  psychological thrillers, and that was just great. Throw in Dissociate Identity Disorder, Killing, creepy stalkers, and
  some of the best disillusion I've ever seen where reality and imagination literally blur, and it's just awesome. It
  was an amazing movie with a great narrative, an amazing feel of suspense, and a surprisingly well done horror. The
  plot twist too... such a great movie. Mima as a character was pretty interesting as well ignoring all the other
  aspects, as she confronts her ideals of idol vs acting, and I was engaged. </p>

</aside><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">I kinda have to wonder though: what would this movie be like in a live action? It
  was originally supposed to be a live action, and if they did it, they probably would had the same effect, maybe it
  could have been better because it would have felt more real (but I really don't mind because I watch a lot of anime),
  but that's just food for thought. About the actual visuals, it hasn't aged perfectly because you know, it's nearly 20
  years old, but it's Madhouse so it's held up pretty well and it really shouldn't hold you back. I have nothing really
  to say about the soundtrack, didn't really notice it at all.</p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Overall, I really loved Perfect Blue, and I'm really looking forward to enjoying
  through his other works. It's aged, but it's just as great as it was in the 90's. For more thoughts, check out
