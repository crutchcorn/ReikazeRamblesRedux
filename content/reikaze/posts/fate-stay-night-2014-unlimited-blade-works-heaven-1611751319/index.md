<div><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">For those of you who were under the impression that the new Fate/stay night was going to
  be a new story which acts as a sequel to Fate/Zero, or if you are a saber lover, you're out of luck. Ufotable &amp;
  Type-Moon did a live stream announcement yesterday, and what we are getting for the TV anime is a split cour
  adaptation of Unlimited Blade Works, the second route of the Fate/Stay Night VN, and a Heavens Feel Movie on the side.
  They showed off 2 new PV's and they also announced a mobile game nobody cares about.</p>

  pretty mixed. I'm pretty sure I'll enjoy the hell out of it, and what matters is the execution for this, but I was
  looking forward to a new story, and i'm not sure how this'll transition for most fans. Also, this split cour trend is
  annoying, kinda wish they just did a continuous run, but not a big deal. Also, if they do the HF movie right, that may
  just become one of my favorite anime movies. </p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">If you have no idea what I'm talking
