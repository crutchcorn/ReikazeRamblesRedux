  There’s always an exception to the rule, and now this exception to the rule has made it’s way to the west. With great
  pacing, a beautiful story and a tense tone that really makes it feel like a thriller, <em>G-Senjou no Maou </em>by
  Akabeisoft2 is one of the best VNs in the west, and <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","http://rockmandash12.kinja.com/rockmandashs-top-10-favorite-visual-novels-1677663938",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://rockmandash12.kinja.com/rockmandashs-top-10-favorite-visual-novels-1677663938" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one of my personal favorites</a></span>.

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Also, for those who would rather not read, here’s a video review! That being said,
  it’s based on an older version of this review and game (instead of the official release in the west by Sekai Project),
  so please keep that in mind as you watch through it. If you want to hear my current thoughts however, continue on
  :)</p>

<img alt src="./1529558210926076232.png"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Like the medium itself, the strength of<em> G-Senjou no Maou</em> has to be the
  story it has to tell, since it provides and portrays its messages extremely well. If you asked me how to explain<em>
    G-Senjou no Maou</em> however, I’d tell you that it’s the <em>Death Note </em>of Visual Novels, as they share quite
  a bit of similarities: they cover similar topics and have similar themes, they have a similar tone (of tenseness but
  not explicit morbidness), and are focused on a cat and dog game in which masterminds battle with their wits to achieve
  their goals.</p>

<img alt src="./1529558210962473544.jpg"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">In <em>G-Senjou no Maou</em>, we follow Azai Kyousuke, the stepson of a Yakuza
  boss. During the day, he acts as a typical high school student, but at night, he helps run the “family business”,
  covertly working for his stepfather as ruthless financial heavyweight. This idyllic existence is broken when two
  individuals appear in the city - an awkward yet absolutely brilliant girl named Usami Haru who happens to have way too
  much hair, and a powerful terrorist known only as “Maou”. Almost without delay, Usami Haru &amp; Maou begin a deadly
  game of cat and mouse, bringing Azai and his friends into the crossfire. Plotting, political intrigue, mystery and
  bleak topics like kidnapping, terrorism, murder, hostages, the Stockholm syndrome, and massacre are the just some of
  the topics that are covered in this epic battle of wits, and it makes the work a great experience.</p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">The most important aspect of the experience and the biggest thing that<em> G-Senjou
  no Maou </em>shares with <em>Death Note </em>is not the content, but how the story is told: it’s a very high energy,
  high tension work with the thriller trait that made <em>Death Note </em>stand out from the crowd, and what makes <em>G-Senjou
    no Maou </em>stand out from the crowd as well. In a genre full of exposition and meticulousness, seeing something
  paced remotely fast is a nice change, and keeps the game engaging. The story never felt too fast or too slow, but
  because of its tense tone, the story feels fast in comparison, an emotional roller coaster that was a blast.</p>
<img alt src="./1529558210997070408.png"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">To add to this, the characters in this work are amazing and engaging, with the two
  that are in focus (Usami Haru and Maou), really taking the cake. From the “Hero” Usami Haru with her unique and quirky
  personality that truly makes her feel like a real (if albeit weird) person to the “Devil” Maou who is mysterious and
  charismatic, <em>G-Senjou no Maou </em>focuses on a duo that is engaging, with engaging attention grabbing
  interactions which that create a real dynamic that is spectacular and absolutely some of the best parts of the game.
  The way they subvert the themes of heroism and the stereotypical relationship with the villain, the interlocking fates
  that leave everyone morally grey, the way that it influences everyone else while being engaging by itself, all about
  this relationship is absolutely fantastic. A lot of this trickles down to the rest of the cast too, but maybe not to
  the same extent: while those two are by far the best characters in the game, <em>G-Senjou no Maou’</em>s cast in
  general is pretty great, as they are entertaining to see with interesting interactions, and are pretty fleshed out,
  making for a great experience.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">To top this package off, <em>G-Senjou no Maou</em>
  outdoes itself with an absolutely amazing ending. As you go through the game, the narrative slowly progresses and gets
  better, peaking at the end: the last chapter is fantastic and that epilogue… that epilogue. The epilogue is one of the
  best endings I’ve ever seen - it’s extremely moving and memorable as it hits you hard with touching scenes while
  feeling like everything fits perfectly, providing closure in a way that’s rarely seen in a work (while being open
  ended enough to feed curiosity). Personally, I’d be the happiest person in the world if they made a sequel, but I’m
  completely satisfied with how it ended. This is how you end a game, this is one of the best endings I’ve ever seen.
</p>

<img alt src="./1529558211023025736.jpg"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">If I had a complaint with the writing of the game, it would have to be that the
  game has issues with consistency at times. Flow between scenes isn’t perfect, tonal shifts can be wonky, and the
  writing in general has some issues as some things conflict with each other. To make matters worse, everything I’ve
  been saying about the story is referring to the main route, but the second you step out of it, the writing gets
  significantly worse. The alternate routes don’t make sense in the context of the story: the only reason they happen
  are deus ex machina happening to satisfy the requirements to branch off to these routes, and they derail insanely in
  tone, story, etc, with major continuity issues that totally took me out of the game every time I tried to play them.
  Also, the writing quality of those routes in general aren’t as good as the main, so I’d just ignore them entirely.
  That being said, with fantastic stories and great characters, the overall writing in this game is pretty good, and
  it’s worth your time if you’re into it.</p>

<img alt src="./1529558211087874632.png"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><em>G-Senjou no Maou</em> is a VN from 2008 made by a well known dev Akabeisoft2,
  so there’s a level of quality expected from the visuals, and those are reached, for the most part. There’s not much
  really to say here, the character art is pretty good, detailed and consistent, some of the background art is rather
  nice, the CG in the game looks pretty good and the overall aesthetic is nice, but there’s nothing that jumps at you
  and nothing about the visuals of this game is really mind blowing. It’s nice, but it does its job, nothing more,
  nothing less.</p>

<div class="ooo3c9-0 PpIMM has-video media-large embed-frame"><span class="flex-video widescreen"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PLFACB1CED3B908B79" width="560"></iframe><span class="js_recommend" data-chomp-id="PLFACB1CED3B908B79" data-recommend-id="youtube://PLFACB1CED3B908B79" data-recommended="false" id="youtube-PLFACB1CED3B908B79"></span></span></div><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Once again, we have another Visual Novel with a musical related name, (even to the point
  that music plays a pretty big role in the plot) and once again, we deal with a stellar soundtrack to go along with it.
  If you asked around the community to see what they think of the soundtrack, you’d probably hear that many think it’s
  some of the best in the genre, but it didn’t quite do that for me. I personally thought it was good, but not the best
  in the genre, but this depends on your taste in music: A good chunk of the music in the game is remixed classical
  music, and while good at times, the music didn’t really do anything special to me. It’s used extremely well, to amp up
  tension and make the mood of the work (with some of the tracks like “<em>Close Your Eyes”</em> being absolutely
  fantastic), but the music itself isn’t the best in the genre, and definitely not the most amazing to listen go outside
  of the game. That being said, in now way am I trying to say that this soundtrack is bad, that’s doing it a disservice.
  It’s pretty good and does its job well, sounding great and being very effective. The voice acting is also great too,
  with everyone doing a good job (and the re-release not really changing any major thing). The most notable voice was
  Maou’s, as they casted Jun Fukuyama, which was an amazing choice as he fits the character so well. Overall though,
  good sound for a game with music in the title with tons of music references throughout.</p>

<img alt src="./1529558211423551304.png"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">If there was a Visual Novel that really surmounted the idea that VNs are an experience,
  it’s this one, as it is an absolute blast to go through, with a tone that makes the game extremely engaging
  throughout. During my first run of the game, I came into <em>G-Senjou no Maou</em> right after re-watching <em>Kara no
    Kyoukai</em> and I couldn’t think of a better way of getting into something like this, as the thematic similarities
  really made those flow together and get me in the right mindset for the game. I love thrillers, so <em>G-Senjou no
    Maou</em> made me smile like I’m some kind of idiot, with the experience playing through the game being an absolute
  blast. Everything blended to make a roller coaster of a VN, with the battle of wits being some of the most fun to go
  through, the characters amazing to see and the mystery something that was extremely compelling, making this VN is a
  stellar experience.</p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Also, I loved the main ending, with the epilogue… it was mind blowing. The void left
  after that ending... was just amazing… it was to the point that I wanted to start up the other routes, but the void
  wouldn’t let me.... I couldn’t get my mind off of that ending, and thus this review exists. I wanted (and still want)
  an after story-like conclusion, just because of how awesome the characters are, and how awesome the ending was. This
  game has an amazing plot that will drive most people to love it, and I’ve had a great experience with <em>G-Senjou no
    Maou</em>, so much so that I was hooked on it and didn’t do anything else for a day and a half and played all of the
  main route in one full run.</p>
<img alt src="./1529558211460569672.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">I’d like to mention my second run for this update of the review, as it was a bit
  different and may give you insight on the replayability of this game: I knew the twist and knew the mysteries because
  making it less of a blast, more of an enjoyment of times gone past. I forgot how entertaining this VN is at times with
  writing that put a smile on your face at all times (especially Usami Haru’s one liners), and the Slice of life that it
  has at the beginning is fun too, even if not best part of it. It doesn’t have much SoL, but what we get is really
  effective, not not too long or too short. Even though I knew everything, it was enjoyable all the time, and led to
  nights with a lack of sleep. It was just as fun as before, and really, the experience playing though this game is
  fantastic. (Also, the epilogue was just as effective the second time around. I was in tears throughout.) </p>

<img alt src="./1529558211617356616.png"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">We live in a changing world, one where the genre of Visual Novels is slowly
  expanding out of the west, with the fact that I can even have a section about the changes that publishers makes is
  bringing me to joy. In Fall 2015, Sekai Project released <em>G-Senjou no Maou </em>in the west, but 2015 is a far cry
  from the 2008 that this game was originally released in, and things have changed. It’s mostly small things, but its
  worth mentioning regardless.</p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">The first change that you’ll notice happens before you even buy the game: Sekai
  Project split the game into two versions you can buy, a version with voice acting, and a version without because
  licensing fees are rather expensive. I’ve played it both times with voices, so I may not be the best to say this, but
  the voices are nice, but not necessary, so I’d recommend trying to get the voiced version, but if you can’t, you’re
  not losing anything dramatic by going without voice acting.</p>
<img alt src="./1529558211652361032.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">The biggest change is the aspect ratio, as while Akabeisoft2 decided they would
  upscale the visuals into the world of HD, they also thought it would be be a splendid idea to crop the game. I’ve
  thrown in screenshots from both the Sekai Project release and the original release so you can see the difference, but
  really, this is a minor change and you won’t really notice it as you play through the game, and it certainly doesn’t
  hinder the experience. While some may complain about this, I applaud the change, as this was one of my biggest
  complaints with the visuals of the game (if you check out the archives, that’s pretty much my only complaint), and
  it’s ridiculous how we deal with 800x600 so much considering we live in 2015, a world dominated by high resolution,
  widescreen displays. Along with this, there’s been an overhaul in the UI, a change that’s rather nice. I was
  originally bothered by the fact that the buttons made the game look much more cluttered but if you are like me and
  want to hide it, you can do that, and it looks good.</p>
<img alt src="./1529558211688107848.png"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">The only other changes that’ll probably really change your experience are the fact
  they got rid of h-scenes (good riddance if you ask me), and they got rid of the explicit warning that you were going
  to change routes. Yes, it’s still pretty obvious when you deviate, but it’s not explicit, which changes your
  experience. Neither will completely ruin or dramatically change how you perceive the game, but both are noteworthy
  regardless.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">One last thing that is worth mentioning, one I thought was cool but
  personally turned off is the display of the music titles, something I wish every VN had because it’s rather awesome.
  If you want to know you can, and if you want to just be immersed, you can turn it off, no harm no foul. This is how
  additional functions should be added to games, and I really appreciate it.</p>

<hr class="gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw"/>
<img alt src="./1529558211693882440.png"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><em>G-Senjou no Maou</em> is a thriller of a VN and great example of how varied this
  genre can really be, and it really deserves its place of regard as one of the best VNs (at least according to the
  west). It’s a great experience, written well with a great premise and great characters, to the point that it’s a game
  that should not be missed.</p>
