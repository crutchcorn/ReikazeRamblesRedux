We haven't had any Ani-Debates yet, but we have some organized, and the ones that are running currently are on hold because meeting up is hard due to IRL commitments and timezones. There have been some new ones added, so check some out, and if any of the old ones interest you, join some. I'll probably do a blip every month.\
