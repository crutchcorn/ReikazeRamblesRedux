<div><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">We haven't had any Ani-Debates yet, but we have some organized, and the ones that are
  running currently are on hold because meeting up is hard due to IRL commitments and timezones. There have been some
  new ones added, so check some out, and if any of the old ones interest you, join some. I'll probably do a blip every
  month.<br/><br/><span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10QY02SYKePpEsoTPHWt2gK4wznJS0ZyC8bqN1rtAtwA/edit?usp=sharing",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10QY02SYKePpEsoTPHWt2gK4wznJS0ZyC8bqN1rtAtwA/edit?usp=sharing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/dâ€¦</a></span>
