  visual novel written by Kotaro Uchikoshi and Takumi Nakazawa. While Uchikoshi and his Zero Escape series has been
  getting a lot of attention, the directer and other writer for ever 17, Takumi Nakazawa’s stuff has been getting
  absolutely no attention at all at least in the west, with I/O and his other games being almost completely unknown. I’m
  here to try change that. This is my review of I/O, one of the most interesting visual novels i’ve ever played. Also,
  this review exists for several reasons, but the most important reason is to say thanks. <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","http://lemniscatranslations.wordpress.com/",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://lemniscatranslations.wordpress.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lemnisca translations</a></span>, headed by GundamAce and Blink Winkel are translating
  some of the most unique visual novels out there. If you are a fan of the Infinity series, you owe it to yourself to
  check out their work and what they are going to do in the future.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Note: Gutted the
  review because it was brought to my attention (and I noticed) this review has massive spoilers! if things don’t make
  sense, that’s why. </p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> I/O is a mystery cyberpunk game set in 2036. The world isn’t much different than
  ours, except everything revolves around the net. It’s a world where reality and virtual reality collide, and I love
  how believable it is. I remember a few years ago, I tried to write a story with a very similar setting. I never got
  around to that, but this world in I/O is essentially everything I dreamed of from that. The setting and premise is
  amazing, with conspiracies abound, futuristic tech, and something that’s actually believable.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> The writing and tone of this game is like a mixture of Ever 17 and Remember 11. It’s
  mysterious and serious like Remember 11 was, but the insane amount of detail, character interaction and pacing is more
  akin to Ever 17. It’s great, as it absorbs you into this world and it keeps you interested with a fantastic mystery
  and solid writing. If you are like me and are a big fan of those games, this one will be right up your alley,
  absorbing you into this world and getting you interested in all that it has to offer. It was fantastic.</p>
<blockquote class="sc-8hxd3p-0 nvIqO" data-type="BlockQuote"><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> “A total lunar eclipse
  occurs for the first time in 3 years. Even though it’s supposed to be a simple astronomical phenomenon, it soon sets
  off a series of unexpected events. Unexplainable mysteries, terrorist incidents, and network crime surge as if in
  unison. The truth mixes with lies, as if the world is awake but still sleeping. Something has begun. Somewhere no one
  can see. Something no one knows about.” </p></blockquote>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> While I/O is written in a nonlinear fashion, the routes are very similar and have a
  lot in common with each other. While the first 2 routes are pretty normal, after that, this game is essentially a big
  mindscrew. This game likes to play many tricks on you, and has the typical from the Ever 17 writers, so if you played
  that you know what you’re getting yourself into, but with it turned up to 11.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> Other
  than the mindscrew, there are few minor things in the writing I had issues with. The first thing I didn’t care for is
  the plot structure which makes parts of the game feel unnecessary, and I/O was way longer than expected with my
  playthrough clocking about 55 hours.</p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> To me, I/O is a good story, abit flawed. It was too much mindscrew for my mind, and
  I couldn’t handle it. If you can get through the mindscrew, you might have the perfect story in your hands.... but if
  you can’t, it’ll be a good story with a major flaw.</p><h4 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h113801"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>Writing - 7/10</h4>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> The characters…. There’s too many to go over, but they were solid overall and are
  the reason why you play through the game. The game doesn’t have a protagonist, instead it has an <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleCast",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleCast" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ensemble cast</a></span>,
  where every character is fully fleshed out, with well stated motivations, great personalities, interesting backstories
  and interesting relationships. The characters were spot on, and are absolutely fantastic. </p><h4 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h113802"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>Characters - 9/10</h4>
<img alt src="./eubhaf59e1fqtj73vmox.png"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> Average, for the most part. You read, and make decisions, and that’s the jest of
  it. What I/O does differently is that it has this annoying yet interesting Defrag system, where after you finish some
  routes, it unlocks parts of other routes, and you need to essentially play parts of the game twice to get the true
  ending. Trying to figure out what routes is the main issue, as the completion thing they show at the end of every
  route is near useless at telling things. In this Defrag system, there’s 3 types of routes: Login, Defrag, and Logout.
  Login is the start and has 4 routes that you have to completely finish (requires backtracking), Defrag, which is the
  mindfuckery section, and Logout, which is an epilogue of sorts, but they have their own climaxes and feel like a waste
  of time, even if they do wrap up the story. Other than that though, it’s quite normal, and as such, it gets a normal
  grade.</p><h4 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h113803"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>Gameplay - 7/10</h4>
<img alt src="./wy9oow5olytlqophctdz.png"/>

<img alt src="./696950678638524962.jpg"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> The visuals in I/O are average at best. There’s a lot here, so that’s no problem, but the
quality of the art itself could be better in my opinion. The character art is jarring, especially at the beginning,
but you’ll get used to it. I think there’s a lot of missed potential here, they could have built a beautiful sci-fi
looking world, but it looks very modest. Some things look dated, like the cell phone calls, the 4:3 monitors
everywhere, and the typography. Visually, it’s kinda dated.</p>

The music is done by Onoken, and he did a great job. This is
  some great music, everything’s done very well, and is used excellently. It’s pretty good, but it’s not perfect, and
  they need a bit more quantity; you might get tired of some of the tracks because of how few they have. One track I’ll
  never get tired of is Theme of LEM, which is absolutely fantastic. I really liked the voice actors, they did a great
  job of expressing the characters, and I had no complaints.</p>

<img alt src="./jdsdyqap9orlqyhr2riv.png"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> This game will surprise you. I/O is not for the faint of heart, with all the
  mindscrew, but looking back on it, I thoroughly enjoyed I/O, as I was extremely attached to the characters, but
  totally confused at the same time. There’s a lot of talent that made this, like Takazawa Nakazawa, Romeo Tanaka the
  writer of most of Rewrite, and music done by Onoken. With this talent, I got pretty much what I expected, but <strong>THE
    MINDSCREW. THE MINDSCREW. </strong>It did everything pretty well, but by confusing the player out of the plot, it
  took some of that enjoyment out. Also, the game has a tendency to crash if press enter while voice is going… and it’s
  kinda erratic on when it does it. It was a fun ride though, as even if you are confused, you can still enjoy the
  fantastic charecters, world and surroundings around you. I expected to love I/O, but it does have it’s problems which
  kept me from loving it. </p><h4 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h113806"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>Enjoyment

  they are both really good games with one flaw. This game was absolutely great… until route C, when they started to
  mess with me. Some people might like this more than others. I was really turned off by all the mindscrew.</p><h2 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h113807"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>OVERALL - 7.5/10, Polarization ± 1</h2>

<img alt src="./696950706504418850.png"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> You might have noticed that I implemented a polarization thing in the overall score.
That’s what I think the difference of opinion will be, and it can go up to 2-3 points. I kinda snagged the idea while
reading up reviews.
