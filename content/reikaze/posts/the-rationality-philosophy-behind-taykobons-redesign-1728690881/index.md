  community, you can really see that ethos around. I’ve been redesigning all of the assets from AniTAY itself to my blog
  and now <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","http://taykobon.kinja.com/",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://taykobon.kinja.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Taykōbon</a></span>, but
  unlike my blog and AniTAY itself, I actually have a story and rationality/philosophy to tell about the design so I
  might as well.</p>

<hr class="gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Design is something that’s rather important, and while i’m no
  expert on design, (especially because everything I’ve learned about it has been self taught by reading various things
  online), I’m a firm believer that if there’s something that could be improved when it comes to design, it should be
  done, and that’s what I’ve done here on AniTAY. <br/></p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">When Taykōbon came out, I had very little involvement with the process of the
  design, and I had no reason to, because this was <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://kinja.com/mdubs",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://kinja.com/mdubs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Matt’s </a></span>and <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://kinja.com/protonstorm",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://kinja.com/protonstorm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Proton’s</a></span> little hobby
  project, something I didn’t know about until it came out, other than they needed a review banner and couldn’t think of
  anything so they asked me. I made that review banner that kept that the aesthetics of Taykōbon that matt and proton
  had, and while there was some things that bothered me, I really didn’t pester into it because it’s not really my
  thing.</p>
<hr class="gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw"/><h4 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h112170"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a><em>Hon
  no Waamu</em></h4>
<img alt src="./1416024136542712359.png"/>

<hr class="gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">That was, until I was looking through my hard drive and found
  this, assets for a project I wanted to start up a long time ago but never got around to. This is what I called Hon no
  Waamu/本のワーム, or Bookworm in english. The idea was that I wanted to make a site that packages LNs into digital files to
  be read and easily distributed because Baka-tsuki did a crap job with that. I wanted to make a clean and awesome
  design that would work well for the modern web, but I wanted the design to be quintessentially Japanese, because the
  site would be all about spreading the word about Japanese LNs, and it’s pretty apparent here... hell, even the name of
  本のワーム was a pun on that, as book and japan have the same kanji character of 本 (Hon) in it! That being said, I made a
  few banners and stuff, but that’s about it.... it never took off. I never did anything with it, but 本のワーム/Bookworm was
  what got me thinking, hey, I could use this to make Taykōbon’s design better, and thus was the basis of my design for
  the redesign with the taykōbon redesign, so it’s important to mention here.</p>

<img alt src="./1416024136648893223.png"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">With Bookworm, I followed the few design elements I know: Keep it simple, have symbolism,
and keep it clean. Because of this, I started my design with a flag, and in this case, the iconic Japanese flag. I
found a white book icon and there it was... and it worked perfectly. I extended the red and white motif to the rest of
the elements because red evokes the feeling of japan as a nation due to the rising sun symbolism, so then I added a
dash of clean typography, (Futura MT for English and bolded Meiryo UI for Japanese) and there it is, a design that I
can say is symbolic, and one I was rather proud of. Sometimes, the simplest of things is the best of things.</p>

<img alt src="./1416024136836451367.png"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">本のワーム and Taykōbon are rather similar on concept with a LN focus and Japanese
naming scheme, so when I saw my half a year old assets, it made me wonder how could I keep my ethos for design while
improving Taykōbon? You can see this mindset when you look around the Taykōbon assets, but obviously, 本のワーム and
Taykōbon are totally different.</p>

  &amp; Problems&gt;</em></h3>
<img alt src="./1416024136896755239.png"/>

<hr class="gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">When we talk about improving things, you need to talk about
  flaws that needed to be changed, and man were there quite a bit. Because I say these posts almost everyday, these
  little things bothered me quite a bit.. and no offense, the old design was rather soulless and meaningless. While the
  naming scheme had thought and care put into it, I didn’t see any of that with the graphical design, so I put my
  own.</p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Before I start listing my issues with it, I’ll just say here that I’m one who adores
  minimalistic design, so stuff like Scandinavian design and modern Japanese design appeals to me, and all my steps are
  twords that... some things that bother me may not bother you, but I was bothered with it so it’s part of my philosophy
  when it comes to the design. </p>
<img alt src="./1416024137082994983.png"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">First off, because the assets for Taykōbon was rather rushed at the beginning, they
  kinda wrote it wrong, something that had to be fixed eventually, if you buy into their naming of it. Taykōbon is a pun
  off of the Japanese Tankōbon, a term meant for a book that isn’t complete, but a part of a series, with manga and LNs
  both being Tankōbon. I thought it was a clever name, but they forgot a small bit Tankōbon has extended ko so it would
  need to be either kō, kou or koo on the writing, and I changed that to kō.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Second,
  there was nothing Japanese about it, nothing to support that fun name, nothing to support the material. Taykōbon’s
  logo was a latin character T with an arrow, but what about T&gt; says something about Japanese media? It’s a roman
  numeral italicized with an arrow, and this focus on the roman character bothered me, and so did the thin outline. I
  tossed it out and implemented the book that I rather liked, and implemented the red from 本のワーム in this prototype.</p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Third, the graphical assets looked amateurish. If you read the about page, they aim
  for consistency, and high quality reviews but I didn’t get that vibe from it. It looked low rent and I thought I’d
  spiffy it up.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Also, the font had to go. I’m a font snob, that’s who I am. I swapped
  out the fonts on everything to a more modern font.</p>

<img alt src="./1416024137145079591.png"/>

<hr class="gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">So, I shared these quick mockups of what I wanted Taykōbon to
  be like. The Red background version was the one I liked more with the design elements I was focusing on, and it had
  the inverse color scheme of AniTAY to keep it apart, but I offered the white one in practicality because I was
  confused by how to spell it because Taykōbon had no Japanese spelling before I came, I felt like some elements there
  were better cuz national symbolism, and kinja’s albino so white backgrounds work better here.</p>

<img alt src="./1416024137201963047.png"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Unfortunately, my red color and larger Japanese text was shot down becuase 1)
it’s totally different than what’s currently there so it may confuse people and 2) All the people from Taykōbon
preferred the blue... so to the next mockup!</p>

<img alt src="./1416024137422349351.png"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">This was a real quick and dirty edit, but already you can notice some of the
issues that ultimately led to changes in the main design. First of all, the Japanese design symbolism is gone so I had
to think of something else. There’s the issue of boldness too, as the english text is rather thick of a font and while
that worked as an undertext, it doesn’t work as primary. Also, I consider modern Japanese fonts to be rather sharp, so
the rather thick ikea like futura medium as is didn’t really fit the bill. Also, to keep the current design of the
headers, I’d have to do the white version and thus tweak the image around.</p>

<img alt src="./1416024137518201895.jpg"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">I went to Japanese flag prefectural design because it fits with the elements I wanted and
because it’s what I found. There’s not many Japanese design elements floating around on the english web, or in
graphical design in general as Japan isn’t nearly as web design focused as we are and those there take western
influence because they are kinda paid peanuts.... so the prefectural flags are what I went for... and man are they
great. Usually with one or two colors, they are symbolic, clean and memorable, something I rather dug.. and the book
icon lended itself to an implantation like this. So, I was off to the races trying to make a good flag design to
implement a similar design to keep my ethos of this project, while satisfying what was needed for a good design for
the site.</p>

<img alt src="./1416024137731486759.png"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">I dabbled with the idea of a blue circle like in the earlier red on white mockup, but to
keep it along with current Taykōbon, I did an outline instead, which fit the flag design better and offered a decent
pathway that I could work with. It has a thicker line though to keep with the lines of the book, the prefectural style
and other lines I did, so it is what it is. If I made it thicker, It would be a clone of my own logo, (which I took
the whole circle motif from Taykōbon when it came out...) so I tried to avoid that. When we tried<span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","http://puu.sh/jKRl9/8d86863d5f.png",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://puu.sh/jKRl9/8d86863d5f.png" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> test headers</a></span> it
became painfully obvious my font choice wasn’t working, so I found a slimmed version, and tried again... and it worked
really well, fitting with my design... throw in caps and now it’s turning out really well, implimenting all of the
things I could really want out of the design.<br/></p>

<img alt src="./1416024137792447271.png"/>

<hr class="gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">With that and some polishing, I think the results speak for
  themselves. These assets fix the flaws that one may have with the old assets and it takes it up to another level: it’s
  professional, clean and quintessentially Japanese/Symbolic, to the point that it’s Taykōbon, and it really feels like
  it. It captures the best of the ethos of my design, and the ideals of the old Taykōbon, It’s a design that’s
  beautiful, and it is the new Taykōbon. </p>
