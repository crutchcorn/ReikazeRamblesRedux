</h3>
<img alt src="./1456859305391493265.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">When I heard of <em>Charlotte</em>, I was rather excited, and the premise had a
  decent bit to do with that excitement.<strong> </strong>In <em>Charlotte</em>, there are children that are able to
  manifest superpowers upon reaching puberty, and throughout the story we follow those kids with superpowers. Our
  protagonist is Yuu Otosaka, who has the ability to temporarily possess others with the hopes to use his power to live
  an easygoing high school life but he is caught red-handed by the mysterious Nao Tomori and is forced to transfer to
  Hoshinoumi Academy, where he and the other student council members must help students who have trouble controlling
  their abilities. The show took that premise and handled it well, showing cool and interesting powers, making it so it
  wasn’t extremely stereotypical and handling the plot points well even when it went in a totally different direction
  than it showed in the beginning.</p><h3 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h104153"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>A Great Cast</h3>
<img alt src="./1456859305748970641.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">As a Key work, you can bet that they’ll do a great job with the characters, getting
  you interested and invested in the show and their fates... and you’d be right, for the most part. All of them are
  lively, interesting and fun to watch, with great personalities, great interactions, and interesting quirks that really
  make them shine. The show handled development of the characters well, and if you had to say there was a strong point,
  I’d say it’s the characters. Some may think they’re stereotypical or over exaggerated, but I didn’t see this as a
  problem, as I liked all of the characters they have shown and they kept the show interesting. Nao and Ayumi in
  particular were fantastic, with their interactions with our MC Yuu putting a smile on my face constantly. </p><h3 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h104154"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a><strong>Entertaining as Always</strong>
</h3>
<img alt src="./1456859305824528273.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">It’s not just the characters too: this show is just an interesting and entertaining
  show in general. Solid slice of life, hilarious gags, super fun time with hilarious powers, you name it: This show was
  interesting and entertaining throughout, and it kept me engaged as I was watching the show. There’s a lot going on
  here, and it’s rather fun to watch, with this fun to watch factor being the reason so many people enjoyed this
  show.<br/></p><h3 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h104155"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a><strong>Progressive
  Animation</strong></h3>
<img alt src="./1456859306220218001.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Since <em>Angel Beats!</em>, a lot has changed in this world, and one of that is the
  rise of P.A. Works, who have really improved in almost every aspect, now making much better anime then before, with
  some of the best visuals in the industry. This continues here, as P.A. Works <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","http://rockmandash12.kinja.com/rockmandash-reviews-nagi-no-asukara-anime-1567969970#_ga=1.15697983.888615642.1438970662",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://rockmandash12.kinja.com/rockmandash-reviews-nagi-no-asukara-anime-1567969970#_ga=1.15697983.888615642.1438970662" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">once aga</a></span><span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","http://rockmandash12.kinja.com/rockmandash-reviews-hanasaku-iroha-anime-1642709329",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://rockmandash12.kinja.com/rockmandash-reviews-hanasaku-iroha-anime-1642709329" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in delivers</a></span> with well drawn characters, great background art, a high level of
  polish throughout the show in regards to animation, an attention to detail that is rather appreciated, etc. Nothing
  but praise for the job P.A. Works did here, it’s beautiful.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>*Also, Here’s a

<img alt src="./1456859306308460177.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Just... <em>wow</em>. Around the the middle of the show, <em>Charlotte </em>had
  significant change of tone, into a spiral of despair that changed the entire show while being absolutely amazing and
  breathtaking, if a bit short. With self loathing, a complete change of what our MC was, the lost of one you care about
  immensely and character development in ways that wouldn’t be possible otherwise, the fall to dispair in
  <em>Charlotte</em> was up there with stuff like <em>Welcome to the NHK</em>’s suicide episode by being moving, well
  done, engaging to watch, and extremely captivating, a demonstration of the greatness that this show could have been
  and maybe should have been but wasn’t, the best part of the show in my opinion. If only it was a bit longer...</p>

  Mess of an Ending</strong></h3>
<img alt src="./1456859306726060433.png"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><em>Charlotte </em>has a seriously flawed ending. While the ending may have been
  entertaining throughout and the last few minutes really put a smile on my face (Yuu X Nao everyday!!!), it’s a total
  fucking mess. Once they threw in time travel, everything went downhill from here as the quality of writing, and the
  ability to comprehend the reason of plot elements or the elements themselves went down the drain from there. With
  villains who are super generic and don’t add anything to the plot, deus ex machinas were thrown all over the place,
  impossible developments that make you want to facepalm, and a convoluted, near impossible scheme in the last episode
  that could have been it’s own damn season, this has it all, but not in a good way... so even though I enjoyed the
  ride, I have to say that it’s seriously flawed, an example of things wrong with the story.</p>

<h3 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h104159"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>A Horribly Flawed Plot
  Structure<br/></h3>
<img alt src="./1456859307534076049.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">As amazing as he is, Jun Maeda really does not know how to write an anime, as <em>Charlotte </em>runs
  into many of the same issues <em>Angel Beats!</em> has, mainly a horribly flawed plot structure that significantly
  hampers the story. When seeing what this show could have been with great potential from it’s interesting premise to
  the great characters, one would expect something great... but that’s not what we got because the structure is really
  poor, screaming horrible adaptation even though it isn’t one. From extreme filler at the beginning dragging out
  absolutely too long to the tonal shifting and erratic pacing that made many parts of the show feel rushed and
  undeveloped, the plot structure in <em>Charlotte</em> is all over the place and doesn’t really make too much sense:
  another work that tried to cram way too much into too little time. </p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">While <em>Charlotte </em>isn’t
  nearly as bad as <em>Angel Beats!</em> because it doesn’t have a massive hype train saying it’s the best anime ever,
  it limits itself to a few characters so they’re interesting and is generally entertaining throughout the show, it has
  a lot of the same issues as before, and executed similarly. It was done poorly, developments fell flat on their back,
  atrocious pacing, and the story doesn’t even know what it wants to do: it goes from a slow, slice of life, monster of
  the week to a rushed, character focused and rather morbid story with a lot of back story, to a last episode that could
  have been a whole cour itself... it’s sporadic and a mess.</p>

this gif really demonstrates what it feels like watching <em>Charlotte</em>: watching and anticipating the event
you’ve been looking forward to come by, only for it to rush by and pull you down while continuing around you, and
developments falling flat on their face... it’s not the most pleasant experience. That being said, while it’s
ultimately a flawed experience, it’s not frustratingly flawed like angel beats because it knew some of its limits, not
to throw more characters than it new how to work with and actually develop those that are important... but it’s
another testament to the fact that Jun Maeda and other VN writers should probably be doing VNs along with <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","http://anitay.kinja.com/grisaia-no-kajitsu-the-anime-you-should-not-be-watchin-1651115065",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://anitay.kinja.com/grisaia-no-kajitsu-the-anime-you-should-not-be-watchin-1651115065" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Grisaia</em></a></span><em>, </em><span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","http://anitay.kinja.com/punch-line-the-ani-tay-review-1713427515#_ga=1.16346175.888615642.1438970662",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://anitay.kinja.com/punch-line-the-ani-tay-review-1713427515#_ga=1.16346175.888615642.1438970662" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Punch Line</em></a></span>, <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","http://rockmandash12.kinja.com/fate-stay-night-unlimited-blade-works-tv-is-beautifu-1642722982#_ga=1.83338399.888615642.1438970662",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://rockmandash12.kinja.com/fate-stay-night-unlimited-blade-works-tv-is-beautifu-1642722982#_ga=1.83338399.888615642.1438970662" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works</em></a></span>, and on and on

of the best in the medium, but if not, which is much more common, they crash and burn: Anime has time limits and is
serialized while VNs have a lot of time, along with elements like multiple branching routes. By adapting them or
adapting the writing style to anime, you run into the exact same issues all of these face: boring beginning, rushed
plot, flawed structure... not the best things for an anime, and pretty much everything i’ve been saying here and

<img alt src="./1456859308109804177.png"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Another original Key anime, another round of disappointment. While it has it’s moments, was
a fun experience and does a lot right, there’s too much it does wrong, wasted potential due to a piss poor structure
that includes stuff like wonky pacing, and a story that’s all over the place. I wanted to love it, but that isn’t the
case, a work that, while it didn’t piss me off to no end like <em>Angel Beats</em>, isn’t amazing but merely “good”.
What a work this is... </p>
