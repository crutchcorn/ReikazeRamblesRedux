<div><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">In my opinion, 2014 has been a great year in anime, and just an interesting year in
  general. It's the first year that I really kept up seasonally with anime, It's the first year I've stuck around
  TAY/AniTAY and I've found some shows that I love and would consider some of my favorites… so I kinda have to do this.
  Today, I'm sharing my favorite anime of the year.</p>

<img alt src="./awvgljdrra8xkepwq99v.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Summary: </strong><em>Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works</em> follows
  Emiya Shirou as he is dragged into a Fight-to-the-death tournament called The Fifth Holy Grail War, where people known
  as masters fight with Heroes throughout history, known as servants, for a chance to get the Holy Grail, which grants
  their wishes. This version of <em>Fate/stay night</em> is an adaptation of the Visual Novel route with the same name,
  and in comparison to the Fate route which the 2006 anime by Studio Deen adapted, it focuses more on action, and the
  main character. Also, Rin Tohsaka is the main heroine of this route/anime in comparison to Saber from the Fate
  route/2006 anime. <em>– Summary from the </em><span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://anitay.kinja.com/the-ten-anime-of-fall-2014-to-watch-1659473893",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://anitay.kinja.com/the-ten-anime-of-fall-2014-to-watch-1659473893" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Fall 2014 AniTAY Collab</em></a></span>

  best anime I've ever seen…. But now that the first cour is done, it's not even my top ten of the year. I'm so
  conflicted on my thoughts with this show: It's pretty good and I know that UBW gets better later, but that doesn't
  really excuse how meh this show can be at times. The visuals are glorious, the fight scenes are awesome, and they are
  doing the arc justice for the most part, but I have major issues with the show. The internal monologuing is completely
  gone (which was one of the best parts of the VN), the soundtrack is a complete disappointment, there's something off
  about the show with the writing that just makes me kinda bored, disconnected as I'm watching it. That being said, I'm
  still enjoying it, but nowhere near as much as I thought I would. It maybe because I'm used to marathoning the VN and
  waiting a week is just wrecking the pacing for me, but it's nowhere near as good as I was hoping. I have it here in
  honorable mentions because I don't want to put my final judgment on this show until it's completely done, and there
  are other shows that deserve to be in this list moreso than F/SN. See my article when it's out for my full thoughts on
  this cour, and I'll do a full review when it's done. Let's hope it pulls a <em>Steins;Gate </em>and becomes amazing
  after episode 12.</p>

  at Raizen High, meets the first Spirit, Tohka, and awakens his power to "seal the Spirit's power". Though they may be
  feared and hated beings due to their immense power, Spirits were always alone and knew only combat and death. Shido,

  &amp; Thoughts:</strong> Sorry, guilty pleasure time, but Date A Live 2 is amazing and I really loved it! I'm a fan of
  Romance anime (which will make itself VERY apparent as you read through this list), and this is one of my favorite
  Rom-Com Animes of this year. It was just the right amount of insanity and fun in a show, and <strong>IMS FOR THE WIN,
    IMS FOR LIFE</strong>. It's so well done, it's just so awesome that I can't help but love it... it's really one of

  Konkon, Koi Iroha</h4>
<img alt src="./v1x3dxpt4epbeyhvfp04.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Summary:</strong> <em>Inari Konkon</em> follows Inari Fushimi, a clutzy, shy
  girl who just happens to have a crush on Kouji Tanababashi. She manages to embarrass herself in front of her crush and
  flees from the scene to a local shrine where she saves a fox pup named Kon from falling into the river. Due to this,
  the guardian deity of the shrine, Uka reveils herself to Inari and grants her a wish. Inari being the clumsy middle
  school girl she is, wishes to be the girl that her crush likes… but soon realizes that this isn't what she wants and
  asks to turn back to her original self. Things don't go exactly as planned, and Uta has to give some of her powers to
  turn Inari back to her original form. What follows is a story of change and growing up, a story of facing the
  consequences for your actions. - <em>Summary from </em><span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","http://anitay.kinja.com/the-top-ten-anime-of-2014-that-no-one-saw-1674308533",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://anitay.kinja.com/the-top-ten-anime-of-2014-that-no-one-saw-1674308533" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>the Ten Anime No One Saw article.</em></a></span></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">
<strong>Justification &amp; Thoughts:</strong> Inari Konkon is a great show because it's engaging, the pacing is
  perfect, and the character's change is wonderful. The interactions they have with each other, the relationships that
  change and growth of each character as they react to the situation is done very well, and because of it, there is no
  part of the story that us dull. It's also hilarious and adorable to boot. Also, say it again with me, <strong>IMS FOR
  THE WIN, IMS FOR LIFE</strong>. They really do a great job, and I'm looking forward to what they do in the future.

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Justification &amp; Thoughts:</strong> A show that blends music seamlessly

  Parasyte </h4>
<img alt src="./l7xtws9heprxiks31caq.png"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Summary: </strong>The 17-year-old Izumi Shinichi lives with his mother and
  father in a quiet neighborhood in Tokyo. One night, worm-like aliens called Parasytes invade Earth, taking over the
  brains of human hosts by entering through their ears or noses. One Parasyte attempts to crawl into Shinichi's ear
  while he sleeps, but fails since he is wearing headphones, and enters his body by burrowing into his arm instead,
  taking over his right hand and is named Migi.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> Because Shinichi was able to prevent
  Migi from traveling further up into his brain, both beings retain their separate intellect and personality. As the duo
  encounter other Parasytes, they capitalize on their strange situation and gradually form a strong bond, working
  together to survive. This gives them an edge in battling other Parasytes, who frequently attack the pair upon
  realization that Shinichi's human brain is still intact. Shinichi feels compelled to fight other Parasytes, who devour
  humans as food, while enlisting Migi's help. - <em> Summary from MAL</em></p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Justification &amp; Thoughts: </strong>From the brilliant pacing, to the
  interesting premise and the awesome characters (Migi = best hand), I am really having a blast with Parasite, and it's
  so well executed that I can't help but watch it. It's extremely engaging, it's consistently entertaining, and the
  situations that the characters get themselves into are great. Watching Shinichi grow, develop and change throughout
  the show is phenomenal, the events and action in this show is great, and it's just a blast. It's one of the few shows
  in the year that made me go: <strong>I NEED TO WATCH THIS NOW</strong> because of how well executed it was, and that
  excitement and urge to watch is why I have this on the list.</p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Summary: </strong>Tada Banri, a newly admitted student at a private law
  school in Tokyo, found himself completely lost after the opening ceremony, trying to find his way to the freshman
  orientation. At that moment, he ran into another lost freshman from the same school, Yanagisawa Mitsuo, and they hit
  it off at once. Somehow arriving at their intended goal just on time, there appeared in front of the two a beautiful
  girl holding a bouquet of roses. The girl then whacked Mitsuo across the face with the bouquet and handed the flowers
  over to him. "Freshman, congratulations," was all she said, and then left. The stylish, well dressed, perfect woman
  that had swung at Mitsuo was his childhood friend, Kaga Kouko. As children they had promised to marry each other one
  day, fulfilling their dreams. In order to escape from her, Mitsuo had gone out secretly and taken the examination for
  this well known private college, but now she showed up in the freshman orientation hall. She too had taken the law
  school entrance examination, catching up with him there. <em>- Summary from MAL</em></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">
<strong>Justification &amp; Thoughts: </strong>My romance loving side is showing. Again. Written well, realistic
  characters (except for that damn ghost), awesome interactions, great comedy, and solid drama lead me to love this
  show. I got sucked into the narrative as a part of Feels Thursday, and I loved every bit of it, getting me attached
  and engaged with the characters and the plot. Also, it's written by the writer of Toradora, and it really shows: it's
  just as good as Toradora in almost every way, even having a better ending.

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Summary: </strong>Tonari no Seki-kun is a short series that follows Rumi
  Yokoi. Yokoi tries to be a model student and pay attention in class. Unfortunately for her, she sits right next to
  Toshinari Seki, a guy who, instead of focusing on class, likes to play with various toys and games on his desk. Seki's
  resulting actions often distract Yokoi and pull her focus away from her studies. Is Tonari no Seki-kun really the
  master of killing time like its subtitle suggests, or was it all just a waste of time? <em>- Summary from</em><span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://tay.kinja.com/tonari-no-seki-kun-the-ani-tay-review-1581524248",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://tay.kinja.com/tonari-no-seki-kun-the-ani-tay-review-1581524248" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em> Koda89's review</em></a></span></p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Justification &amp; Thoughts: </strong>I'm typically not a big fan of short
  anime, but this comedy anime convinced me otherwise... It's one of the best comedies out there, and one of the best
  short anime out there. It's hilarious, well rounded, brilliantly paced, has a great concept, and an amazing vocal
  performance by Kana Hanazawa really makes this show great. Really, for what it is, it's damn near perfect, and I
  couldn't ask for more. It's a great comedy, and I urge everyone to watch it... you'll be hooked, just like I was. For

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Summary: </strong>Raku Ichijou is an average high school student. He also
  happens to be the sole heir to the head of a Yakuza Family called the Shuei-gumi. Ten years ago, Raku made a
  promise... a secret promise with a girl he met. They promised one another that they will "get married when they
  reunite." Since then, Raku never let go of the pendant the girl gave him.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> Then one
  day, a beautiful girl named Chitoge Kirisaki transfers into Raku's class. Their chemistry was more than off. There was
  not a moment where they were not fighting. But by a weird turn of events, Raku and Chitoge agree to become fake
  lovers. Although his heart is really interested in his classmate Kosaki Onodera, Raku must continue pretending to be
  Chitoge's boyfriend. <em>- Summary from MAL</em></p>

  a sucker for Rom-Coms, if you haven't learned from this list. <strong>Best Girl - The Animation 2014 </strong>drew me
  in so fast that you can't believe it... and I fell in love. This is a hilarious and entertaining Romantic comedy
  series that had everyone fighting over who was best girl (stop lying to yourself, you know it's Onodera....) while
  just enjoying a very shafty over the top romantic comedy with great characters, entertaining visuals, great writing,
  and just interesting character interactions in general. I like this show quite a bit more than the rest here on
  AniTAY, so it's way higher on my list than most, people would even dare, but I'm that big of a fan of it. I can't wait
  for season 2, such a great show. By that, I mean it litterally as I couldn't wait and now it's one of my favorite
  manga.

  Knights of Sidonia</h4>
<img alt src="./rx5hzxoo9eiq5xrksr0a.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Summary: </strong>It's been a thousand years since the Gauna, a strange
  alien race with no known method of communication, destroyed the solar system. A portion of humanity managed to escape
  using enormous "seed ships" like the Sidonia, which have allowed them to maintain the population while drifting
  through space. Nagate Tanikaze is a young man who has been raised deep in the bowels of the ship. When he goes into
  training to pilot the huge robotic weapons known as Gardes, Nagate is entrusted with piloting the legendary unit known
  as Tsugumori. Nagate and his fellow pilots put their lives on the line against the Gauna, in the ultimate battle for
  the survival of humanity! <em>– Summary from MAL</em></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Justification &amp;
  Thoughts: </strong>So, let's get to pretty much the only serious anime on this list XD. If you can get past the CG
  Visuals, you are greated to a treat: a brilliant and extremely interesting world that actually gets development
  throughout the show and feels like it could be real, concepts that you probably never thought of, an extremely
  gripping narrative, and an awesome tone that keeps you interested in a story. Nothing but praise for this show, a
  shame that it's only on Netflix. Also, it's really cool... probably the mecha I've enjoyed the most in the past few
  years, and when I really like a mecha... I really like a mecha (#CodeGeassFanboi). I think Hideo Kojima's quote about
  it really nails what makes Knights of Sidonia special:</p>
<blockquote class="sc-8hxd3p-0 nvIqO" data-type="BlockQuote"><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> "It's a kind of anime that
  we haven't seen for a while that has that sci-fi spirit. Using digital technology cultivated through games, it creates
  animation that encapsulates Japan's cultural assets like manga, cel animation, kanji, giant robots, etc. What's born
  is a unique made-in-Japan work that could never be cooked up in Hollywood. Japanese culture has lost its "cool," and
  Knights of Sidonia will be the white knight that saves it." </p></blockquote>
