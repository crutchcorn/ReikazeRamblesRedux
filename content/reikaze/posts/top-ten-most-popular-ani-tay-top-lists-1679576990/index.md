<div><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">As we were working on our 15 Most Popular Anime of 2014, We started to think meta. We made
  quite a few lists, so wouldn't it be fun to list the Most popular anime <strong>lists </strong>on AniTAY? We thought
  it was a good idea, (and even if it's not, it's certainly interesting and fun to see) so here it is.</p>
