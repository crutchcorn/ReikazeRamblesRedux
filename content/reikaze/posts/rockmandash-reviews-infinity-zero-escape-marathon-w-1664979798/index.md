I’m pretty well known around here for being a [Fate/fanboy](https://rockmandash12.kinja.com/type-moon-marathon-wip-1534726534), but if there’s one thing that I love more than fate, it’s Kotarou Uchikoshi works. He’s probably my favorite writer, and I started doing reviews because of his works, so I kinda have to do a review marathon of the works he wrote (that I can read). [With the announcement of Punchline](https://anitay.kinja.com/noitamina-2015-lineup-announced-time-slot-reduced-to-h-1664125217), his first anime, it’s about time that I get to that. (sorry, but no Pepsiman though :O)
