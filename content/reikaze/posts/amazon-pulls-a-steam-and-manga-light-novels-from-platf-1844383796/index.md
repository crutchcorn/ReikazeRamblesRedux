<div><img alt src="sbyfnswsrcztjrn1u0at.jpg"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Various Light Novel publishers have announced that Amazon’s been pulling Light
  Novels and Manga off of their platform. <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://twitter.com/jnovelclub/status/1275704028723392514",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://twitter.com/jnovelclub/status/1275704028723392514" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">While this has been happening for a while</a></span>
  to J-Novel Club, Today <em>No Game No Life</em> from Yen Press has been removed, which is the first time someone other

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">According to J-Novel, these happened without any notification, and while Amazon has
  said it was because of Kindle Content removal,<span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://rockmandash12.kinja.com/a-call-for-transparency-and-the-issue-with-steams-eroge-1826128670",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://rockmandash12.kinja.com/a-call-for-transparency-and-the-issue-with-steams-eroge-1826128670" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> just like Valve and removing Visual Novels from S
    <!-- -->team</a></span>, Amazon has not given any explicit reason. This lack of transparency is incredibly
  frustrating, and has lead many to to speculate the removal is simply because of the anime art style that L<!-- -->
  ight N<!-- --> ovels have. This speculation stems because there are many works like <em>My Next Life as a Villainess:
    All Routes Lead to Doom! </em>and <em>I Shall Survive Using Potions</em> that don’t have any ecchi or questionable
  elements yet are getting taken down. If Ecchi is the problem, then expressing that would go a long way. If it’s the
  anime art style then it’s another case of western censorship of expression from Asia simply because they don’t like
  the anime.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">As Amazon is one of the largest players in the industry when it comes to
  book retailers, this will have a major effect on the already small Light Novel industry in the west. Consider
  supporting other retailers like RightStuf, Bookwalker that specialize in Otaku works.</p>
