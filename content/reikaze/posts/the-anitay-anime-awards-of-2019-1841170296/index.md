The emergence of *Demon Slayer*, the laugh out loud romantic comedy that was *Kaguya*, the awfulness that was shows like *ORESUKI*! There was so much in regards to anime in 2019, and here at AniTAY we’re gonna tell you what we think is great! Welcome to The AniTAY Anime Awards of 2019, where AniTAY Authors and AniTAY readers pick the best of the best Anime of the year!

The AniTAY Anime Awards is a collaborative effort by members in the AniTAY community to decide the best of the best of each year. We always try to put our own spin on these kinds of projects because when we see groups that don’t leverage different opinions, the results can radically differ from what the actual viewer think, and offer little choice. That’s why this Award process was open to the community and the decisions made were fascinating. We ran a poll both internally asking the authors of AniTAY as well as asking all the readers, so we have two sets of results. Here we go!
