This isn't really a full on article but I'm going to be shifting gears a bit in my reviews in the next few weeks, so I'd like to get my plans out here.

First off, I'm going to be finally wrapping up the loose ends of my [Type Moon Marathon](https://rockmandash12.kinja.com/type-moon-marathon-wip-1534726534), with Melty Blood and Fate Ilya coming up in the next few weeks. Of course, the marathon isn't over, as it'll be finishing once the Fate/Stay Night 2014 anime airs ,and there's a few games I still want to do that i'm either too lazy to play for review purposes (Fate Extra, Kagetsu Tohya) or aren't completely translated yet (Fate Hollow Ataraxia, Mahoutsukai no Yoru).





Next is a bunch of straggler reviews that don't really belong in any specific marathon or catagory. I have a surprise review coming up next week, and I'm going to be finishing my Steins;Gate reviews because of the official US release. Other reviews that don't really have any deadline or category is I/O (another VN, probably in 1-2 weeks, depending on how busy I am) and Muv-Luv series (1-2 weeks after I/O, to respond to all the hubbub dex is making), the Sharin no Kuni fan disk (Review date TBA) and the Durarara! season one review (because of season 2, Review date TBA),

After the Straggler reviews is a marathon I'll cry about, a KEY marathon. I'm going to try to be as thorough as I can, doing all the Key stuff I can. IS YOUR BODY READY FOR THE FEELZ???? I'll be going in chronological order in the game releases for the most part, except I'll be doing Air before Kanon, and I'll be doing the anime reviews as well as the Visual Novel reviews. Expect a week to 2 week gap for the reviews, as there is a lot of content here to go through. I'll make a separate post like I did for the Type-Moon Marathon too.

So, here's what to expect once I start this up:

1. Air - Seen Anime, haven't played game
2. Kanon - Seen anime, haven't played game
3. Clannad - This one will be long. And Amazing.
4. Planetarian - I already have a [mini-review](http://petesgameroomforum.com/topic/5346010/1/) for this on the forums I was on before I joined TAY, but i'll do a full review
5. Tomoyo After
6. Little Busters - Seen anime, haven't played game
7. [Rewrite...](http://rockmandash12.kinja.com/rockmandash-reviews-rewrite-visual-novel-1516111258) HAHA I ALREADY DID THIS :D I guess I'll spice it up when I get there.
8. Angel Beats \[Anime] - Get ready. This one... will be controversial.
9. Kud Wafter - HORRAY FOR WAITING FOR TRANSLATIONS... :(
10. Rewrite Havest Festa! - This'll be more about waiting for a translation instead of me being lazy... I guess I could learn japanese but KANJI IS HARD :(
11. Angel Beats VN - Also TBA, game isn't even out yet, and who knows when the translation will.
