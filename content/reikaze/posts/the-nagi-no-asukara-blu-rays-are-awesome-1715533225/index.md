Early last year, I wrote a review for Nagi no Asukara, the show that I called my favorite show of 2014. Thanks to [NIS America](http://www.nisamerica.com/), you can get the physical release in america, and my copy of the Complete Premium Bonus Set just arrived!

Seriously, huge thanks to [NIS America](http://www.nisamerica.com/). They’re awesome for releasing this in North America, and they are even more awesome to use a line from this review as a quote on the standard edition of Nagi no Asukara, and for[ suppo](http://tay.kinja.com/the-eccentric-family-the-ani-tay-review-1681742494)[rting](http://anitay.kinja.com/chronicles-of-the-going-home-club-the-ani-tay-review-1692318782) [Ani](http://anitay.kinja.com/daily-lives-of-high-school-boys-the-ani-tay-review-1691636319)[TAY](http://tay.kinja.com/genshiken-second-generation-the-ani-tay-review-1685588095) in general! They sent me my copy of this because of my review, and I couldn’t be happier about it!

I didn’t do a video unboxing because I don’t have a tripod and without that it would look pretty meh, but I thought i’d take some pics:
