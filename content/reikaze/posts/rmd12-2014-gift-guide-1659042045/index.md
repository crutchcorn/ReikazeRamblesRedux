  really like (you can get pretty much anything gaming/anime related tho):</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">
  Anime/Manga, and the respective merch if you can. I really don't have a lot of physical Anime stuff, mainly because I
  can't afford a lot of it. Pretty much anything I've talked about and liked is fair game. I'd really appreciate a copy
  of Clannad: After Story, Welcome to the NHK, and The World God Only Knows as that's what I've been saving up for.</p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Edit - A copy of serial experiments lain would be nice.<br/> <br/> VN's: I talk a lot
  about VN's, but I only have 3 physicals: the Zero Escape series, and Steins;Gate. A physical VN would make me really
  really happy. Also, I still haven't gotten planetarian on steam yet, so I'd be pretty happy with that too.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> Vita games: I LOVE the Vita, but I just don't have any games for it. All my games for it
  are PS+ games, indies, P4G or Ys. RPGs and quirky japanese games would be appreciated.</p>

<hr class="gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Favorite game series: Zero Escape. I'm a pretty big fan of
  sonic, megaman, and a ton of VN series I've gushed about. </p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Systems I Own: PSP, Vita, GBC, GBA, DS, 3DS, SNES, N64, Gamecube, Wii, Genesis,
  Dreamcast, &amp; PS1-PS3,</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Games I typically play:<br/>I'm not really into AAA and tend
  to prefer japanese developed games.<br/>I prefer handhelds<br/>RPG (Action prefered. Nothing too grind heavy... :/)<br/>Racing
  <br/>Platformers (3D preferred)<br/>Anything Nintendo<br/>VN's (.... Yeah... I'm pretty sure you knew this by now)<br/>Puzzle<br/>Indie
  games</p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> Shirt Size: Large</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Figurines: Cool, but not a
  priority atm</p>
