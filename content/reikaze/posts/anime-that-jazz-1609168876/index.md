I have a soft spot for jazz. I just love the soothing and upbeat nature of it. I also love anime. BUT WHAT IF.... WE COULD GET BOTH???? MY mind would be BLOWN RIGHT? THAT'S WHAT I JUST FOUND AND MY EARS ARE IN BLISS :D WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE? If you know any more, post it down in the comments, I'd really appreciate it.
