<div><img alt src="./r0oakcu97edwwcprg08k.png"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">You know this time of the year, the time of the year when everyone looks back to
  judge what this year has to offer. In this aspect I’m no different, with lists being something I always have
  appreciated to show off an individual’s tastes while having fun with the concept of lists in general. Welcome to my
  favorite anime of the year, my Top 10 Anime of 2015.</p>
<div class="bxm4mm-2 hKBnez js_video-sticky__top-limit"></div>

</div>
<div class="bxm4mm-3 eCMXYG js_video-sticky__bottom-limit"></div><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">So, What are the rules of
  this list, you may ask? If it aired/released this year, it can go on this list, it’s just how I view it, as I don’t
  want to restrict a show to just the season it started airing. If this means that one show has a spot for multiple
  years, than good for that show! If it’s an OVA or movie that came out during the duration of the year I fell in love
  with, then it may be there.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Just an FYI, the placement of the show in the list is
  mostly based on my experience and enjoyment of the work, so if you’re wondering why something isn’t where you think it
  should be or you can’t really tell via the justification, that’s probably why. Also, just because a show is lower on
  the list doesn’t mean it’s bad - all of these are great, and a lower placement isn’t a mark against the show, at this
  point it’s nearly all personal preference.</p>

  really care for the adaptation for the show. Really, I hyped it too much, and I felt the burn the whole way through
  because of it due to the with wonky pacing, rough execution of the story, a joke of a soundtrack that fails to do
  anything to the show, and overall rather meh execution that turned my favorite route of one of my favorite Visual
  Novels into a show that rarely managed to engage me at all, a show I tried to love, but couldn’t. Yes, it looks
  absolutely beautiful with some of the best fight scenes and scenery I have seen in this medium, and Yes, the last few
  episodes (especially episode 20) were just great, but those didn’t save it for me, the show that looked flawless on
  paper but came out to be a pretty messy show. It’s not a bad show, and if you’re interested in the series, it’s not a
  bad work to check out, but it really isn’t for me, a diehard VN guy.</p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Justification &amp; Thoughts: </strong><em>JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure, </em>which
  really seems like AniTAY’s anime of the year considering that everyone here talks about it with praise and many have
  put it high up on their lists. That being said, It’s not the type of show that really hits my personal preferences,
  but it is pretty great and the inclusion of it on a top list for 2015 seems like something I need to do, even if I’m
  behind on it.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><em>Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure</em> is a show full of over the top action
  with big burly dudes and absurd scenes are hilarious. It’s action scenes are some of the best I’ve seen in a while,
  it’s overall quality is consistently high thanks to David Production’s great adaptation of it and the show keeps you
  constantly engaged with great comedy and awesome oneliners. If this sounds like your type of show, you’ll probably
  love it.</p>

  violent and attacking humans, who created the Wall of Severance to separate humans and bears. Several years later, two

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Justification &amp; Thoughts: </strong>Yeah, I started the list with a tie.
  Deal with it. The tie is pretty much because I like them for remarkably similar reasons, and with about the same
  intensity (there are things that bother me personally, but overall I really dig them for both), so the only thing that
  made sense to me is rolling them both at the same place. At some point in time this year, <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://kinja.com/MementoMorie",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://kinja.com/MementoMorie" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Morie-Hime-Nee-Senpai </a></span>got
  me into shows directed by Kunihiko Ikuhara, the director of the famous Utena and Penguindrum. After Penguindrum, I
  started watching through the others and considering that <em>Yuri Kuma Arashi </em>aired this year, It seemed to be a
  shame to leave it out of the list. It does a lot right: absolutely amazing visual and narrative directing, great
  characters, an interesting story that one gets absorbed into, and interesting social commentary that’s thought
  provoking and really lead the show for me. It’s a show that’s definitely worth watching - if the yuri and 2deep4me
  aspects don’t bother you.</p>
<div class="ooo3c9-0 PpIMM align--bleed has-video media-large video-embed embed-frame"><span class="flex-video widescreen"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O9addLLuAt8" width="560"></iframe><span class="js_recommend" data-chomp-id="O9addLLuAt8" data-recommend-id="youtube://O9addLLuAt8" data-recommended="false" id="youtube-O9addLLuAt8"></span></span></div><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">With <em>Gatchaman Crowds Insight</em>, we have... Politics in anime? While this may not be
  for everyone and I do have some gripes with how the story is told, it’s the dealing with social topics like <em>Yuri
    Kuma Arashi </em>that really got me into <em>Gatchaman Crowds Insight</em>, doing great job getting people to think
  about the world they live in and getting me hooked. while being a stellar story by itself, with great characters and a
  great premise. By striking at the very core of our society and messing with what it means to be people, the show
  presents ideas and gets you to think more than many works out there, and this is something to admire, something that
  one should hold dear. It’s also truly modern anime, striking at our modern society in a modern way instead of looking
  around to hide, associating with what it believes people are now, something I appreciated, especially when the lessons
  lie in the past. It’s also just a well handled show in general, with great action scenes, amazing development of
  characters and a really well rounded and stylish presentation. It’s truly a human story and I can’t go through this
  list without giving it my praises.</p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Justification &amp; Thoughts:</strong> The first season of Noragami was
  pretty good, but this season really dialed up the awesome in the story - It’s very engaging, the lore just amped up
  how interesting the show was, it has great character interactions to the point of tears with extremely touching
  moments, the characters themselves were fantastic and overall the show and it’s handling of the story was really well
  rounded. While doing the stuff that made the first season great like the comedy from our not so friendly god Yato,
  this season really got us closer to the characters while presenting interesting scenarios, it handled tension quite
  well and was just engaging throughout, a lot of fun to watch. Also, the ending was just amazing, one that you can get
  absolutely absorbed in and one that really lead to a satisfying show, but one that gets you to want more, the ideal
  style of ending to me. Can’t wait for more!plz Bones plz continue this series ;-;</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">

<video autoplay="" loop="" muted=""><source src="./xyxoaqvrevn5bfiv5m3e.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Justification &amp; Thoughts: </strong>I’m a pretty big fan of RomComs in
general, with this list having quite a bit of SoL and RomComs, but even when you like something, a subversion of that
can great. With romance, <em>OreGairu/SNAFU</em> is of the best subversions of the genre, and it’s mainly due to
having some of the best characters that this year had to offer. It was “something genuine”, showing a rom-com turned
drama that shows the essence of people and their interactions, weaving it’s story around messy situations that require
our characters to learn, and to grow. It’s a show that shined with a stellar execution that brings out the best of
what they are offering, a show that let you get to know the characters and the conflicts, and one that just got into
your head with the way people interact. It’s also one with a fair bit of comedy, a show that kept you entertained
throughout. Really, <em>Oregairu </em>is a really enjoyable show, one that a person can easily fall in love with.
Also, it’s opening from Yanagi Nagi makes it all that much better, an icing on the top of the cake for me.<br/></p>

  believe how excited I was when I finally found what I was looking for in <em>Best Girl: The Animation Winter 2015</em>
<em>Saekano</em> which even has the extreme Otaku as the MC! Every episode has been entertaining and hilarious, with
  absolutely amazing character interactions, excellent execution of meta elements, and just well written comedy in
  general. All the characters here are just fantastic and the premise really enables this show to use them to their full
  potential.

  <em>Shirobako</em> are a bit deceiving and don’t actually represent what happens in the show, stating that Shirobako
  is the story of five girls who, after making a short anime while members of their high school animation club, promise
  to come back together as adults and make their own full anime. I believe that, it’s the story of everyone involved in
  Shirobako trying to do their best, to succeed with their goals, usually involving the creation of anime. While the 5
  girls do make an appearance in the story and are what the story starts with, they are just a piece of the puzzle, a
  part of the grand scheme, and it actually focuses more on the struggles of the animation studio Musashino, and the
  people there. <em>- Plot Description from my review of Shirobako</em></p>

  made me appreciate all the things that the people making anime have to deal with, and to get this peek into the world

  sports anime, becoming one of my favorite anime genres out there. With the pros of Shounen without many of the flaws,
  So, you may ask, why 4 shows at the spot, which seems insane given it’s a top 10 list? Simple: I can’t pick between
  them, with all of them being absolutely fantastic in the experience department, with extremely well done characters,

  Non Non Biyori Repeat</em></h3>
<img alt src="./qq34wobhr7yfoponohaa.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Plot Description: </strong><em>Non Non Biyori Repeat</em> continues
  following the lives of four girls: the first-grader Renge Miyauchi, the fifth-grader Hotaru Ichijo, the seventh-grader
  Natsumi Koshigaya, and the eighth-grader Komari Koshigaya, as they attend school and kill boredom in the village of
  Asahigaoka in the Japanese countryside. <em>- Plot Description by Koda from the Anime You Should Be Watching
    Article</em></p>
<div class="ooo3c9-0 PpIMM align--bleed has-video media-large video-embed embed-frame"><span class="flex-video widescreen"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/liniqGHdXbM" width="560"></iframe><span class="js_recommend" data-chomp-id="liniqGHdXbM" data-recommend-id="youtube://liniqGHdXbM" data-recommended="false" id="youtube-liniqGHdXbM"></span></span></div><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Justification &amp; Thoughts: </strong>Yes, a slice of life is 3rd on the list, but
  when it’s good as this, it doesn’t matter. When you were a child, have you ever spent any considerable amount of time
  wandering around your neighborhood with the sheer curiosity of a child or spent time goofing around with friends? Non
  Non Biyori Repeat, being the masterpiece of slice of life that it is (And really, this is an amazing slice of life...
  one of the best with <em>Silver Spoon &amp; Barakamon)</em>, hearkens back to the time of what it is to be a kid,
  while showing realistic yet charming relationships that are extremely well done, putting a smile on your face at all
  times as you watch this life unfold in front of you. It’s not a show of action, but a show that is to be enjoyed...
  there’s no plot here, or anything at all... but what this show does offer is relationships between characters that are
  both moving and entertaining at all times, humor that seems childish, but is rather brilliant. Really though, this
  show is a panacea, wiping all of your issues away as you watch through the show in a state of bliss, smiling and
  enjoying the scenes as they unfold, from the hilarious to the moving.</p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">What sets <em>Non Non Biyori </em>far and away from it’s competitors is how it feels
  to watch, the experience it creates for the viewer. I’m sure everyone here has some fond childhood memories that they
  have, or some they wished to have: well, by being the best slice of life you can imagine, <em>Non Non Biyori</em>
  captures that feeling, and makes you feel it, soothing you as you experience this once again. It presents you the
  wonder of experiencing something new, the feeling of losing something you hold dear but eventually learn that
  everything’s OK, the feeling of just having fun with people you care about... feelings of childhood that you won’t
  ever be able to get back, but can try to get back in a show like this. In this time where we rush everywhere to do
  anything, a break is necessary, and what break is better than relaxing with some childhood experiences? This is a
  great experience, and it’s one I fell in love with.</p>

  One Punch Man</em></h3>
<img alt src="./ne6zmzz0olgnf6elb1nx.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Plot Description:</strong> In this new action-comedy, everything about a
  young man named Saitama screams “AVERAGE,” from his lifeless expression, to his bald head, to his unimpressive
  physique. However, this average-looking fellow doesn’t have your average problem... He’s actually a superhero that’s
  looking for tough opponents! The problem is, every time he finds a promising candidate he beats the snot out of them
  in one punch. Can Saitama finally find an evil villain strong enough to challenge him? Follow Saitama through his
  hilarious romps as he searches for new bad guys to challenge! <em>- Plot Description from MAL</em></p>
<img alt src="./nk6jve38v0ibxopwkxb4.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Justification &amp; Thoughts: </strong>While <em>One Punch Man</em> isn’t
  the savior of anime like how the internet jokingly refers to it, <em>One Punch Man</em> is a really good subversion of
  the superhero genre that’s been flooding the movies one that manages to take the seriousness of the action flicks and
  turn it into comedy by mocking the tried and true tropes, something I really enjoyed seeing because i’ve gotten so
  tired of these superhero movies on the silver screen. The core of the strengths this show has is because of the main
  lead and it’s namesake, Saitama who is one of my favorite leads I’ve seen in a long time. Saitama’s reactions putting
  a smile on my face throughout the show and the way that he just destroys everything in one punch is played more
  interestingly than you would think.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Because of the nature of the show, making fun of
  a really popular and easy to watch show,<em> One Punch Man</em> is also easily accessible, and when combined with the
  fact it’s extremely hilarious, <em>One Punch Man </em>is the popular show of the year, an engaging show that I and
  many others had a blast with. Unlike other shows though, it earns it’s popularity with some of the most engaging
  action scenes anime has to offer, tons of fluidity in the animation which makes it look great, hilarious interactions,
  etc. It’s a show that is a joy to experience, and it’s one I loved, definitely a must watch in the year and one of my
  favorites. It’s a show that maintains a high level of quality, one that makes for a blast to watch at all times. Plus,
  how the hell do you say no to something with a JAM Project opening like this?</p>

  They’ve lived together for years, in a world of crazy crime sci-fi sensibilities. Now someone is threatening to sever

<img alt src="./eghm4idpawlcn4vsh4ih.jpg"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Justification &amp; Thoughts:</strong> I said it back in Spring 2015 that
<em>Kekkai Sensen </em>at was going to be the top of the list, and now that we’re at the end of the year, here it is,
AOTY for me. Written by the genius who brought us the classic Trigun, <em>Kekkai Sensen</em> is an amazing episodic
show that does a lot right, a show that will hook you in like few shows really can. It’s a show that presents an
amazing world, a vibrant, extremely well crafted Monster New York that drags you in with interesting changes to
reality, stylization that keeps you constantly engaged, and an atmosphere that makes this setting feeling more alive
than pretty much any other setting out there. It doesn’t just end there either: pretty much everything about this show
deserves praise, from the extremely memorable and awesome characters (Zapp!) to the brilliant presentation and music
(Dat Jazz!) and the absolutely engaging scenarios that happen throughout this story (Chess!). This is a show that I
admire as it is the type of show I always look for, being experience first by showing you some absolutely interesting,
engaging and amazing scenarios that can either hit hard (Feelz about hamburgers... ;-;), be really entertaining (That
guy where all the bad things happen XD) or just be absolutely outstanding to the point that every aspect about this
show is just brilliant and and a joy to watch, showing how episodic shows are done right. Almost everything about this
show is something I adored (The wait for the last episode.. not so much...) and it all added to a package that as
amazing and hit all the right strings for me, Anime of the year.</p>
