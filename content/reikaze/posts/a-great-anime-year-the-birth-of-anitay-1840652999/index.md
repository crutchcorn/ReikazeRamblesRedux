  been all that remarkable overall, in regards to anime 2014 was one of the best that I’ve ever seen. From a hoard of

  and let’s take a trip down memory lane to look back on what I would consider to be one of the fondest moments in

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Winter 2014 was <strong>PACKED</strong>. But before we can talk about the 2014 shows
  themselves, we need to talk about Winter leftovers from 2013: 2014 was in the transition phase to shorter anime,
  before anime basically moved completely over to 12-13 episode shows, but not comprising of mostly 24 episode series.
  Because of this, a core part of the seasonal experience was the leftovers and the season was basically split in half,
  with the new winter 2014 shows, and the 2nd half of Fall 2013 as well. </p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">With just the
  leftovers alone, there’s more I watched in the leftovers in winter 2014 than I do in entire seasons.<em> </em><span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://tay.kinja.com/kill-la-kill-the-ani-tay-review-1554090665",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://tay.kinja.com/kill-la-kill-the-ani-tay-review-1554090665" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Kill La Kill</em></a></span> was the return of GAINAX in the form of everyone’s
  favorite studio TRIGGER, and boy did they make a splash. Basically everyone was talking about this show, and basically
  everyone liked it’s crazy symbolism, unique designs and amazing action. <em>Kill La Kill</em> was/is Trigger at it’s
  finest, and we were all there for that. If you were a sports anime fan, this was a good time to be watching as two of
  what I would consider to be the best sports anime,<em> </em><span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://anitay.kinja.com/yowamushi-pedal-the-ani-tay-review-1599570106",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://anitay.kinja.com/yowamushi-pedal-the-ani-tay-review-1599570106" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Yowapedal</em></a></span>,<em> </em><span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://anitay.kinja.com/ace-of-diamond-seasons-1-2-the-anitay-review-1765876386",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://anitay.kinja.com/ace-of-diamond-seasons-1-2-the-anitay-review-1765876386" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Ace of Diamond</em></a></span><em> </em>just started and were (and still are for the

  one of the first ones to do it and one of the few that actually serve as competition in both quality and fanbase was
  the first season of <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://tay.kinja.com/dexs-review-log-horizon-1550619505",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://tay.kinja.com/dexs-review-log-horizon-1550619505" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Log Horizon</em></a></span>. This was before the juggernaut
  isekai genre took over the industry and we all called the shows “the trapped in an MMO” subgenre, but <em>Log
    Horizon</em> was special not just because it was a<em> Sword Art Online</em> clone but because it an actually good
  show. Everyone had the catchy DATABASE, DATABASE stuck in their head, the more MMORPG approach and more strategic
  outlook on the show made it a fun watch week by week.</p>

  shows of the leftovers, and they were fairly controversial at the time.<em> Nagi no Asukara</em> quickly became one of
  my favorite shows thanks to it’s amazing presentation, atmosphere and engaging character dynamics (that you may love
  or hate), and <em>Golden Time</em> was <em>Toradora</em> 2.0 but in college and with crazy shit like Ghost Banri, but
  overall both were an amazing time.</p>
<img alt src="./rvyk0gzgxljox3b2xdwr.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">As for the headlining new shows, The waifu wars was in full force this season with
  the ever controversial<em> </em><span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://tay.kinja.com/nisekoi-is-a-harem-romantic-comedy-anime-that-centers-a-1582395958",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://tay.kinja.com/nisekoi-is-a-harem-romantic-comedy-anime-that-centers-a-1582395958" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Nisekoi</em></a></span>. While
  not everyone liked it’s fairly troopy style of romantic comedy, everyone watched it which lead to a lot of fun
  discussions on the Skype chat we had for AniTAY. Everyone was blown away by the wonderful <em>Noragami</em> which
  followed the minor got Yato that does odd jobs for 5 yen a piece. The character drama and action was quite good and
  the show was fairly consistently engaging throughout the show.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">2014 was a weird place
  for anime in the west - with shows like <em>Space Dandy</em>, it was clear that now the western world definitely had a
  voice and an impact on a show. <em>Space Dandy</em> was a show made for the west, created by the legendary Shinichirou
  Watanabe co-funded by adult swim and airing the dub before the sub. I personally didn’t watch the show but it was a
  wacky and episodic in nature. Anyone who was unfortunate enough to watch<em> Chuunibyou 2</em> was bored to tears as
  literally nothing happened, in a stark contrast to the first season. It’s weird to see KyoAni stumble, but even then
  they do every now and then.<br/></p>

  2014</h3>
<img alt src="./iuy424crcln03kg04s3q.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Following up that winter was an almost equally as strong spring, headlined by
  arguably the best sports anime ever, <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://anitay.kinja.com/haikyuu-the-ani-tay-review-1637543181",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://anitay.kinja.com/haikyuu-the-ani-tay-review-1637543181" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Haikyuu</em></a></span>!
  This show is fun to watch thanks to its blend of comedy and action, it does an incredible job of making you feel the
  action, the character interactions are on point, and it’s not just winning - <em>Haikyuu</em> does an incredible job
  of showing losing too. Production IG knocked this one out of the park, and it’s fantastic. PS: it also has a kickass
  soundtrack.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Also one of the best sports anime aired this season through Yuasa’s<em>
  Ping Pong The Animation</em>. This show was kind of a sleeper hit, as most people didn’t watch this until after the
  season ended, and it was limited by the fact that a lot of people just refuse to watch sports anime. If you wanted to
  watch one though, this was it - This show was perfectly paced, the story was an extremely well done coming of age
  show, the animation is extremely unique, etc. All in all, it’s another Yuasa great and comes highly recommended. </p>

This one was huge,
  as it was AniTAY’s very first and did extremely well, wracking up ~35k reads. This season was also the birth of AniTAY
  proper, as before this season AniTAY was a tag on TAY. While there was some controversy in the creation of the blog

  2014</h3>
<img alt src="./lgvu8rlfjppn5j3myghw.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Summer 2014 as a whole could be argued as weaker than the extremely strong winter
  and springs, but the headlining shows still were up there in quality and community engagement, competing with the best
  of times. <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://anitay.kinja.com/tokyo-ghoul-the-ani-tay-review-1636678069",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://anitay.kinja.com/tokyo-ghoul-the-ani-tay-review-1636678069" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Tokyo Ghoul</em> </a></span>was the big show of the season. Fantastic
  OP, interesting premise, great voice work and a shounen style story is a quick way to draw a crowd.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://anitay.kinja.com/gekkan-shoujo-nozaki-kun-rockmandashs-ani-tay-review-1634657276",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://anitay.kinja.com/gekkan-shoujo-nozaki-kun-rockmandashs-ani-tay-review-1634657276" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki Kun</em></a></span> was my
  personal favorite and one of my favorites of the year, a hilarious romantic comedy that subverts and lampshades shoujo
  tropes to create entertaining comedy. The cast really stood out here, as the main leads Nozaki and Sakura are just
  adorable dorks who are fun to watch and the supporting cast is one of the best in anime. Kinema Citrus showed their
  prowess with one of the best coming of age comedy shows out there in the form of <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://anitay.kinja.com/barakamon-the-ani-tay-review-1642020651",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://anitay.kinja.com/barakamon-the-ani-tay-review-1642020651" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Barakamon</em></a></span>. The show really makes you feel like you’re in rural japan
  with authentic dialect and charming moments about normal life that would be ignored in a more urban setting. Seeing
  Handa grow throughout the show and seeing the adorable naru be a cute little kid made for an engaging show, and with
  Nozaki Kun this was a one-two punch for anyone who liked comedies, and as a fan of anime comedy, this was my jam. </p>

Supposedly written by Gen Urobuchi, it
  was a hot mess of a mecha show that has the most unlikable, dumbest characters in existence. I’ll like to just say
  here that I told everyone it was going to be shit from the beginning. <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://anitay.kinja.com/akame-ga-kill-the-ani-tay-review-1671140613",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://anitay.kinja.com/akame-ga-kill-the-ani-tay-review-1671140613" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Akame ga Kill</em> </a></span>was the show everyone was talking about this season - a
  show about a band of assassins and their conflict. I thought it was fun but needlessly “dark”, and wrote an article

  which is still one of my most viewed and favorite articles to this day. Zankyou no Terror was another Shinichiro
  Watanabe show about a group of terrorists, I felt like it was a bit style over substance but plenty of people loved
  it. </p>

  the continuation of the ever popular Sword Art Online and this time we had a very feminine looking Kirito and guns! I

  content with one season of a free cash stream, made another season of <em>Free! </em>In the form of <em>Free!: Eternal
    Summer</em>, and of course many people fawned over the hot dudes.</p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">As for other shows: If you seriously, actually loathed yourself and wanted to

  a fun harem comedy that was dragged down by poorly done drama, but still a good time nonetheless. </p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> So, while the summer season still had some strong shows, it wasn’t a very deep
  season and many of the smaller shows ended up being fairly disappointing. That being said, it was still a fun season
  overall and I had a fun time watching and reviewing plenty of these series. This season I with a few others started

  most touching and moving coming of age dramas that anime has to offer. Add to it the uplifting Goose House OP, the

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Fall 2014 was a great time to be a fan of classic style action anime, with Parasyte

  In this season we would see KyoAni again knocking it out of the park with their brilliant<span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://anitay.kinja.com/ani-tay-review-amagi-brilliant-park-1676761418",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://anitay.kinja.com/ani-tay-review-amagi-brilliant-park-1676761418" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em> Amagi Brilliant Park</em></a></span>.

  everyone’s favorite Gugsy had an avatar from that show for ages but is one of those anime that does the same show over
  and over again. And last but not least for this article,<em> Yuuki Yuna</em> was a unique take on the magical girl
  show that I’ve heard nothing but praise about but nobody really watched it.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Overall,
  it was a great time to be an anime fan. While there wasn’t many true standouts that would come t dominate the medium

  excellent quality, to the point that some of them can be seen as modern classics. Each season felt strong and every

  would definitely be one of them and I would highly recommend you go back and watch some of these great shows.</p>

  mostly because 2014 was a really important year for me in regards to anime and this community. Basically, this year of
  anime simultaneously got me into seasonal anime and was one of my favorite years of anime. When I was younger, I
  watched cartoons and some anime, but I definitely wouldn’t call myself an anime fan. I started playing Visual Novels
  and as a result watched some anime but I didn’t really get <em>into </em>anime as a hobby until when I joined AniTAY
  in late 2013/early 2014. I stumbled upon Dex’s old reviews and decided I’d join the TAY Platform. I eventually found
  the old Skype, and joined AniTAY full force in 2014. </p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">When I say full force, I really meant it back in 2014, it was my junior &amp; senior
  years of high school, my college applications were done, and there was a lot of time on my hands. I was really into
  seasonal watching thanks to the bustling community we have and watched like 3/4ths of the shows mentioned here as a
  result, wrote a ton for my blog RockmanDash Reviews and AniTAY. I think I watched more anime in 2014 than I did like
  the past 3 years combined or something like that, and that experience would have never been possible without you guys
  here on AniTAY. Even at the time I enjoyed this year of anime, a year of great shows that compelled me to start
  my<span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://anitay.kinja.com/rockmandashs-top-ten-anime-of-2014-1676188044",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://anitay.kinja.com/rockmandashs-top-ten-anime-of-2014-1676188044" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> top anime of the year lists</a></span>. I feel like both I and AniTAY grew
  tremendously during this year: when I look back on 2014, I look back on it incredibly fondly, as quite possibly my
  favorite year in regards to anime and one of the best years for AniTAY as a whole and for that, I thank you. </p>
