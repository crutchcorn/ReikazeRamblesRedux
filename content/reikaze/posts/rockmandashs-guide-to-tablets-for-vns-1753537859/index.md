<div><img alt src="./orjxjlpcqa9jbmoxarbj.png"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Many people in the VN community have turned to tablets for playing visual novels
  as they are one of the best options to improve your experience, but when people in the community look for one, they
  may ran into problems trying to pick the tablet they want to use. Like any electronic device, there are plenty of
  information on tablets out there, but because there’s so many options out and almost nothing comes from a visual novel
  perspective, it becomes hard to decide which one you want. Of course, this is because VNs are a niche genre and
  thinking of what aspects of tablets is important for visual novels is hard when you don’t have experience with both,
  but I’ll try to help. Welcome to Rockmandash Reviews, and today I have another guide, this one being a request from
  many people: a Guide to Tablets for Visual Novels. </p>

  the pros and cons of getting a tablet for visual novels, check that. Just a refresher though, in that article I
  decided that the best tablet experience is a windows tablet based off of the x86 architecture, meaning it can run
  regular windows applications. This means in this video every tablet I am going to be talking about is going to run
  windows, so this means no iPads, no android tablets, because Windows is the most important part for compatibility with
  visual novels. Get it? Got it? Good. Let’s move on.</p>

<hr class="gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw"/><h2 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h113245"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>Cheap or
  expensive?</h2>
<img alt src="./e86h4hz9u27d9wfuncrh.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">If you’re interested in getting a tablet for VNs, the first thing you need to decide
  on, like any other product, is how much you want to spend. Of course, you’re going to get a better product if you
  spend more, but before you drop hundreds of dollars on a tablet, ask yourself this: what do you need out of it? If you
  want to replace your laptop or an aging tablet you own, spending a fair bit of money would make sense, but if you are
  using it to play visual novels, I would recommend getting a cheap one - tablets are inherently a creature comfort, and
  this is especially the case with VNs. If you are only using it for visual novels, the extra bumps that more expensive
  tablets give you may not improve your experience with visual novels, so you probably shouldn’t consider them. Yes,
  better build quality is always better but in respect to nearly everything else, you’re not necessarily getting a
  better experience - performance doesn’t matter with VNs as they’ll run on nearly anything without a problem, High
  Resolution screens are a double edged sword in regards to Visual Novels, and spending more on a bigger screen is
  entirely up to personal preference.</p>
<hr class="gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw"/><h2 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h113246"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>The
  Quality of the Screen - High Resolution or Not?</h2>
<img alt src="./dsoku6dzvbbgrop02qsv.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">When buying a tablet, the most important aspect is the screen, as it dictates your
  entire experience, and is the biggest differentiating factor when it comes to windows tablets. To me, spending the
  little amount to get an IPS display is a must as having a good display makes all the difference but paradoxically, as
  of January 2016 when this video was made more pixels on the display can actually make your games look worse, thanks to
  bad windows scaling on tablets. When picking up a recently released game, these can look absolutely fantastic Visual
  novels are almost always built to run one resolution and those are generally low. Thanks to this, windows can make
  games look flat out blurry -so consider that when playing your game. That being said, high res screens make for a
  better experience in almost every other case though so this is an important decision you need to make when you buy a
  tablet, if you want a high res screen for newer content and most tablet cases, or a lower resolution screen for older
  content.</p>
<hr class="gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw"/><h2 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h113247"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>Subjective
  Aspects of Screens - Aspect Ratio &amp; Size</h2>
<img alt src="./ypvqjmh7uzwjylh8lasu.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">While pixel count of a tablet matters in regards to the quality of the screens,
  there are elements of the screen that aren’t in regards to quality, but are more focused on how you want your device -
  light and portable or large and immersive? Square and Fit for VNs of the past, or wide and ready for what’s coming up
  in the future? These are the size of a tablet and the the screen ratio, which is completely personal preference when
  it comers to visual novels. First, in regards to Size - there are 3 major sizes - 8 inch, 10 inch, and 12-13 inch,
  each with different purposes. While there may be smaller tablets than 8 inches or larger than 12 inches, I can’t
  recommend them, as smaller tablets feel cramped when you use them, and large ones are way too large to hold. </p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">If you’ve owned a gaming device before, ask yourself this: do you prefer a console
  experience or a handheld gaming experience? This preference is pretty similar to the screen size you’ll want on a
  tablet, as smaller tablets are similar in size to handhelds and larger tablets give you an immersion closer to
  consoles, and are similar to laptops in general, to the point that the category is pretty much convertibles or 2 in 1s
  now. Also, ask yourself if you’re going to use your tablet for work and stuff outside of visual novels - if so, go for
  a 10 or 12 incher - the smaller tablets don’t make for a great experience outside of visual novels as they feel very
  cramped in the desktop environment.</p>

<img alt src="./ru8uefe1xjlzb4qsfmam.jpg"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">For VNs, 8 inches is my personal preference, because the compact size lets them
  be light and easy to hold, making them perfect for entertainment and reading on the go, like a small novel. From my
  experience, they work really well for especially visual novels because they are small and light so they are easy to
  carry and play anywhere, but like mentioned earlier, not so great for other tasks. On the other end of the spectrum is
  12 inches: too large to use in your hand really and you kinda need a kickstand to use it comfortably, but it’s the
  popular size for convertibles because it’s plenty of screen real estate for getting work done in the windows
  environment, and in regards to VNs, it’s more immersive. 10 inches are a mix of both, more comfortable in other
  applications and more immersive, but manage to be usable in the hand and are portable, but you’ll probably want a
  kickstand regardless. This is up to personal preference really, and whatever you need will influence you, but if you
  are just using it for VNs, 8 inches is the best.</p>

<img alt src="./sy5iil6j9y9xnbnzx97w.png"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">As for aspect ratios, that is the way the screen is shaped, the orientation of
  pixels. There’s the more square 4:3, the wider 16:9, or stuff in between, and they influence how you experience them
  by having massive black bars when dealing with content that isn’t the orientation. People like 4:3 for reading and
  tablet apps in general, it’s the orientation of an iPad and people like 16:9 for watching stuff, but in relation to
  Visual novels, base it on if you read older VNs more or if you read newer ones as a lot of older VNs are 4:3, and a
  lot of newer ones are 16:9, which at the moment there are more 4:3 VNs out there but most people are probably more
  used to 16:9. Idealistically, you’d want to get something in between like a 3:2 tablet, which will have bezels no
  matter what visual novel you play but with smaller bezels in comparison to others, but you can count the number of
  good 3:2 tablets on one hand and they’re expensive, so that’s kinda out of the question. Personally, I like the wider
  16:9 aspect ratio in tablets but I’m a minority in the tech space, and this will come to personal preference.</p>

<hr class="gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw"/><h2 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h113248"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>Performance
</h2>
<img alt src="./cx7juc31xfjmucdaenhu.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Performance doesn’t really matter in VNs as all of them are powerful enough to run
  VNs fine, but this will come into play if you get a tablet for other use cases. There are 3 types of chips in tablets
  as of 2015 for windows tablets, all by intel: Atom, core M, and the regular core i series. Atom is essentially a cell
  phone chip, and you’ll get cell phone like performance out of Atom chips, so they aren’t the greatest for something
  like editing, but should run light stuff like VNs and web browsing fine. Core M is a low power chip that is made for
  tablets and thin laptops, being cool enough to not require a fan while giving good enough performance for everything
  you need unless you’re doing something like editing, while the core i series is your full on laptop chips and will do
  anything but take up more power. That being said, you’re spending a lot more for the better performing chips so if
  you’re getting a tablet for VNs, just get an atom, you’ll be fine.<br/></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Also, like the
  processor, ram plays a small part in your experience with VNs, but it’s really important in normal use. I’d highly
  recommend you go 2gb at minimum, but 4gb is going to provide you a much better experience.</p>

<hr class="gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw"/><h2 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h113249"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>Storage
</h2>
<img alt src="./yzsnnqozhcjtcizkrng9.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">On the other hand, with storage, get as much as you can afford as visual novels take
  up space, but if you can’t afford a tablet because of storage, just try to get the best tablet for your money. That
  being said, make sure it has a micro SD slot, as they make all the difference by being able to add a lot of cheap
  storage and because it’s removable you can easily load up VNs that you have on another machine.</p>
<hr class="gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw"/><h2 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h113250"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>Etcetera
</h2>
<img alt src="./wiglthwqpgtrnbtvqsqf.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Consider a Chinese tablet! People don’t like Chinese electronics for completely
  valid reasons, but with tablets, they’re really ahead of the curve with windows tablets and quality of components at
  certain price points as the western market kinda gave up on tablets. If you prefer android, there are plenty of dual
  booting tablets so you can have the best of both worlds.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Before you do any purchases,
  you definitely need to check out reviews because while something may sound great to someone like me, it may not be the
  best for you, and someone who goes through reviewing these devices can grade them objectively, as well as teaching you
  something about a device you should know before you buy a tablet. </p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Last but not least, I’m going to remind those here, you should install
  touchmousepointer because it makes small touch targets much easier to hit and it makes the windows tablet experience
  much less frustrating. Now we’re done with that, time to move onto my recommendations. </p>
<hr class="gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw"/><h2 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h113251"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>My
  Recommendations (As of January 2016)</h2>
<img alt src="./iokbaaiwod2dxyipwu7r.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Now that you know what type of tablet you want, here are some specific choices that
  fit the categories out there. I’ve tried to cover as much ground as possible but I’m not perfect so if you know a good
  tablet, just shoot me a message and I’ll look into if I should add it in. Also, these are subject to change as new
  devices come out.</p><h3 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h113252"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>8 inch Tablets
  - Small but Portable, Perfect for a VN</h3>
<img alt src="./fafudauooilwnaetpzzk.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Any Cheap Windows 8 inch tablet with a 1280x800 Display: </strong>For those
  who are really price conscientious or have a favorite brand they like, any run of the mill 8 inch tablet will do, like
  the Lenovo Miix 8, Dell Venue 8 Pro (0riginal), Winbook 8, Chuwi vi8, etc, anything you can get on sale, at a great
  price or as a gift, anything goes. That being said I would say that an 8 inch tablet is a minimum though so don’t go
  smaller than this as your experience suffers, and stay away from the HP Stream tablets, I tried them and they are
  pretty bad with static noise issues in the headphone port so they aren’t recommended.</p>

  on Dell’s Overpriced refresh of the Venue 8 pro, you can get essentially the same thing for $100 dollars. Yes, it’s a
  Chinese tablet, but it’s fairly impressive for what you get at $100 bucks - mainly a 1080p display that matches other
  high end small tablets and looks great for a fraction of the price and is a rarity out there, solid build material
  with it’s metal sides and provides a great experience overall. Hell, it has a feature that only the Chinese tablets
  have that improves your experience with it, and that is it can dual boot to android so if you like android games, this

  Xiaomi is known as the Apple of China because of the quality of their products, but there’s a few big differences:
  Xiaomi releases products at great prices (which are, to be fair, hard to get), and use standard parts and software,
  which allows this guy to play all the VNs you want. Their newest tablet, the Mi Pad 2 is one of the few 4:3 windows
  tablets at this size, and it matches the quality an iPad Mini with a thin and high quality metal chassis. The only
  real downside to this for me is the fact it lacks a memory card slot, but other than that, it’s a pretty good pick.
  The windows version isn’t out as of writing this (comes out on the 26th), but the android version has gotten great

  (Starts at $900, Keyboard is an Extra $125): </strong>It’s a device that defined what tablets and 2 in 1s were going
  to be like, and the newest one is better than ever with a better designed chassis that doesn’t have a tendency to
  overheat and a really great keyboard, one that moved over to chicklet keys. If you’re looking for a tablet that serves
  as a laptop with full laptop processors and a tablet that shows others how it’s done, the surface is a great piece of
  kit that you should check out.

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Other Convertibles - HP Spectre X2, Dell XPS 12, Lenovo ThinkPad X1, etc
  - </strong>You know how I said that the Surface is showing others how it’s done? 3 Years after the original concept
  was shown, Microsoft’s partners have finally followed suit in creating devices that compete by... copying Microsoft,
  making tablets that are pretty similar to the Surface line while trying to match it in quality. They’re usually
  cheaper but try to improve on the surface in some way (Trackpoint ftw!). I personally wouldn’t buy one, but if you’re
  interested, definitely give it a shot.</p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Budget 2 in 1 - Teclast X2 Pro (~$350, Keyboard is an extra $35): </strong>If
  you don’t have that kind of money for a tablet like the Surface Pro 4 but you still need power for day to day tasks,
  power that atom won’t cut it for, theTeclast X2 Pro is something to consider with it’s 11.6 inch 1080p display, Core
  M, m.2 storage and 4gb of ram all for under the price of a Surface 3.
