  shows out during this season, but in every winter we get excellent shows that manage to be the best of the year, shows
  that make anime worth watching. This season is absolutely no exception, and here’s my list of them: Welcome to
  Rockmandash’s Top Anime of Winter 2017!<br/></p>

  on the Season Overall</strong></h2>
<img alt src="./j40o7iemzk9lxklpip9z.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">While the rest of the anime community was dying to see spring come, saying this was
  a lackluster season, I was quite enjoying it, with a core of amazing shows that winter always seems to have. Sequels
  to amazing shows, surprise hits, and great adaptations of works with great source led to a great season, and I
  couldn’t be happier with the way it turned out.<br/></p>
<hr class="gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw"/><h2 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h97350"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a><strong>Rules</strong>
</h2>
<img alt src="./rfxtya3lg0lsh2kxcys8.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">My rules of this list are simple: if it aired/released this season, it can go on
  this list. I don’t see the point in only giving a show one chance during it’s airing season, and this is my list so
  I’ll list my favorite shows regardless of what season it started on. If this means that one show hogs the top spot for
  2 seasons, than good for that show! If it’s an OVA or movie that came out during the duration of the season I fell in
  love with, then it may be there. Also, I think that the seasonal split is arbitrary and unnecessary, so it’s
  completely gone here. Sorry about that, but that’s how I’m doing it.<br/></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Just an FYI,
  the placement of the show in the list is mostly based on my experience and enjoyment of the work, so if you’re
  wondering why something isn’t where you think it should be or you can’t really tell via the justification, that’s
  probably why. Keep in mind, just because a show is lower on the list doesn’t mean it’s bad - all of these are great,
  and a lower placement isn’t a mark against the show, at this point it’s nearly all personal preference.</p>

</p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Justification &amp; Thoughts:</strong> Let’s get this straight: You probably
  shouldn’t watch<em> Rewrite</em> Season 2, but it definitely deserves mentioning.. not because it’s a fantastic show,
  but because it’s by far the *most improved* show I’ve ever seen. <em>Rewrite</em> Season 1 was a steaming pile of
  garbage, a show with almost no redeeming values due to a fundamental lack of understanding of the source material by
  the anime staff. It was clusterfuck of epic proportions, with 8bit showing once again that they have no idea how to
  manage a visual novel: it mashed together all the routes into one horrifying thing that would occupy your TV, it was
  simultaneously too fast and too slow, it spent a massive amount of time on boring slice of life that didn’t serve any
  purpose, etc.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Season 2 however, is a passable show, and is one that actual humans can
  enjoy! This can be mostly contributed to the different structures of the routes covered: in season one, they tried to
  adapt the common route, as well as simultaneously adapt 5 separate routes, but in season 2, we have 2 linear stories:
  Moon and Terra. They managed a faithful adaptation that was entertaining, moving, etc. It was surprisingly good, and I
  enjoyed it every Sunday it came out.</p>

  Dragon: </em></strong>When Miss Kobayashi rescues a dragon named Tohru on her way home from work, the mythic creature
  falls for the office worker and agrees to repay an eternal debt. Taking the form of a human maid, Tohru begins to
  familiarize herself with the normal ways of the new world. Not long into her services to Kobayashi, however, other

  - until his school has a sudden influx of them at the beginning of a new term. His three new students and the new math
  teacher are all <em>Ajin</em> - and prefer to be called a more modern and cute term, <em>Demi</em>. Takahashi-sensei
  now spends his lunch breaks and afterschool time cheerfully interviewing these monstergirls, learning what’s fact and
  what’s fiction while trying to help them solve their everyday high school problems.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">

  were a lot of great Slice of Life shows this season, and all of them were quite enjoyable, but I found that while all
  of them should be mentioned in some form, I didn’t think that any of them really warranted a spot on the list as
  individuals given how great the top shows of this season were, so I thought I would compile them all together (Though,
  <em>Gabriel Dropout</em> was slow to get good early on this season). They were all very entertaining shows that were
  executed well, doing what all good slice of life shows should do: they all continuously showed us different aspects of
  the characters we see, were all consistently entertaining, had amusing character interactions, were filled with funny
  jokes, and more. If you’re looking for an entertaining slice of life or just a show to entertain you while you’re
  trying to deal with a bad day, these are all a show I’d recommend.</p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Justification &amp; Thoughts:</strong></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><em>ACCA</em>
  is a deceiving show in every way, you can think about it. You think the show is going in one direction, but it goes in
  a completely unexpected direction. You might assume some things about it, but then the show laughs at your
  assumptions. Ultimately though, while it wasn’t what I or anyone really expected, it was a very compelling show. Great
  mystery, interesting twists throughout, an atmosphere that made this show incredibly unique and style that no show
  this season could even compare with... all of this made this a phenomenal show and <em>ACCA</em> was an enjoyable
  ride, even if the ending was a bit disappointing.<br/></p>

</p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Justification &amp; Thoughts: </strong>If you like dramas, there is no
  better place to look than at<em> Scum’s Wish</em>. It’s a refreshing show, one that revels in desires and character
  interactions unlike anything an anime (or TV in general) has covered, but while it’s so vastly different, it feels so
  relatable, because it is simply the execution of a human story. While the desires of the characters can be considered
  as the title suggests, the desire of something one can never get, and having to live our live without being able to
  even dream of it is something that is ultimately relatable, and that is the magic of this show. we see human problems
  with human relationships and human characters, wrapped in a package that is compelling, engaging and more. While this
  show may not be for everyone, for those who it is for, they will absolutely love it.</p>

<strong>Genre: </strong>Military, Magic</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Plot Summary: </strong>In an
  alternate version of the year 1924, war rages on, but the most deadly soldier around is neither a grizzled old
  veteran, nor a wise and patient general. Rather, it is a very young girl by the name of Tanya Gurtcheff, whose mind
  for tactics and affinity for magic are both second to none. While most of Tanya’s military colleagues either applaud
  her endless victories, or fear her merciless attitude, not a soul is aware of her true nature. Despite appearances,
  Tanya is no mere little girl, but a ruthlessly efficient Japanese salaryman, reincarnated into this parallel world
  after angering a being which called itself “God”, as a wager to see if hardship and turmoil would kindle religious
  devotion. Eager to prove “God” wrong, Tanya is prepared to use every trick in her arsenal and claw her way to the top
  of this new reality, in order to once again live a comfy and peaceful existence</p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Justification &amp; Thoughts: </strong>Like the character Tanya, the show
  <em>Saga of Tanya the Evil </em>beats all the odds in a world made for it to fail, defying everything one would expect
  from it. A show with a loli as a main character in a boring and grey war show, made with a brand new studio... nothing
  good could have come out of it, but it managed to be amazing. After<em> Izetta </em>bombed last season with an almost
  identical premise, we expected that out of Tanya... but instead we got what <em>Izetta </em>should have been, a
  fascinating alternate history twist on world war 1 with our main character not being your typical little girl, but a
  deeply logical Japanese businessman turned into a little girl and facing a relentless battle against god, aka being X!
  Seeing this conflict was extremely entertaining, adding onto the enjoyment that comes from Tanya as a character, and
  the amazingly animated fights. All and all, a stellar show.</p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Justification &amp; Thoughts: </strong>It would not be an understatement to
  say that Rakugo is one of the best shows I’ve ever seen. Season 1 was phenomenal; a beautiful and extremely well
  executed historical drama that absolutely took me and the AniTAY community by surprise. While the plot of Rakugo may
  sound boring because it’s literally about telling stories, it is the execution, how it tells the story that makes this
  great, being able to handle all of its elements extremely well. The show has fantastic pacing, solid visuals, a great
  score, amazing characters and the best part: it’s consistently engaging with every episode being better than the last.
</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Season 2 is more of everything great about Rakugo Season 1... but while the quality of
  Rakugo never falters, being a phenomenal show until the end, Season 2 made a fundamental change that takes away from
  what made me love the show so much, so personally I didn’t enjoy season 2 as much. Season 1 of Rakugo was a historical
  set piece, a flashback to a time when master Yakumo was growing up and his story, in one of my favorite settings.
  Going from a historical coming of age to a more modern story following a yotaro/former criminal as he does rakugo...
  it wasn’t exactly what I was hoping for. Definitely worth a watch, and the ending is phenomenal, but it isn’t as
  golden as Rakugo Season 1.</p>

</p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Justification &amp; Thoughts: </strong>Konosuba Season 2 might just be the
  funniest anime that I have ever seen. Season one of Konosuba was already a riot, a show that both played with the
  tropes of a fantasy &amp; isekai story as well as dealing with an amazing cast, season 2 amps it up. The cast is
  funnier, the scenarios are more entertaining, the antics are better, etc. While the animation quality might have
  dipped, they use the animation more effectively, to make the gags better, to make the show more entertaining, and it
  really worked. Every moment, every episode had my laughing, and I was always looking forward to the newest episode of
  this show. I don’t think I’ve laughed as hard as I did with Konosuba this season, and I’m not sure if I will ever
  again.</p>
