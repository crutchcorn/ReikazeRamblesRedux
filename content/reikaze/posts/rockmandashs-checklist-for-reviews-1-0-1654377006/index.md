<div><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> When I write up a review, there are aspects of the work that I try to cover, and the best
  reviews in my opinion cover all of these. I decided to make a checklist of aspects that need to be covered in reviews,
  and I thought I might as well share it. Keep in mind that these are just things I think that should be present in a
  review and it's not in a specific order.</p>
