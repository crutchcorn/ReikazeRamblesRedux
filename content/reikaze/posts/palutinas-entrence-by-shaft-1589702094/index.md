When Nintendo introduced Palutena from Kind Icarus to Smash Bros, They had an anime trailer of Link and Pit fighting, with obviously Palutina fighting. SmashBrosJP tweeted that the animation short was done by Shaft. I was not expecting that, considering how rough (in my opinion) it looked, and how Nintendo usually goes to Production IG. Here's the [Crunchyroll](http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2014/06/10/video-shaft-animates-palutena-super-smash-bros-introduction) article... but there's a severe lack of headtilt (there's some minor ones, but not shaft levels...). I thought it was really neat that Nintendo would do this trailer, Quite awesome of an E3 showing this year :)
