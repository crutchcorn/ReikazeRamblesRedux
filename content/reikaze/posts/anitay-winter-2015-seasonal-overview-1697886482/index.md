  time should know these shows; the shows that the most notable parts of these shows are how much much skin they show.

  are it brings along copious amounts of obscurely angled cameras, conspicuous wind, violating entanglements, ripped
  clothes, and most famously, trips into <em>cupped </em>positions with fellow cast members. This show is centered
  around one man and his magic-based trials set in his high school. Although he starts off as seemingly average, the
  true extent of his powers quickly take form. Our protagonist finds a way to stand out from the crowd from the get-go,
  as his good intentions have always been in place. However, this show starts its downfall when all the fanservice and
  cliché harem moments begin. The punchline of most jokes somehow stem from the protagonist being a pervert even though
  everyone else is mistaken, not everyone can see his good intentions because they are blinded by their own desires and
  are more concerned with winning the harem, and the most crucial moments in character development only happen when a
  girl is missing most of her clothes. Not to mention that there's one character that seems way too young to be involved
  in all of this. There are many things wrong here and in all, a show like this really doesn't stand out because there
  are many more that are just like it, and frankly, this one is near the bottom of the hierarchy. </p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Military! Is a short form (approx. 3-4 min episodes) ecchi, moe, comedy series. This
  is definitely one of those "guilty pleasure" series, as the ecchi is very strong, with the adult gags contrasting
  sharply with the extremely cutesy and childlike designs of the characters. Visual and animation quality is fairly poor
  too. In fact there is hardly anything redeeming in the content at all, except the show is HILARIOUS. So if you care to
  indulge in any sort of perverted humor at all, you should give at least the first episode a try. </p>

  which means a mecha that's still stupid, but still entertaining for some reason. As this season continued to pull the
  same stunt over and over again, many got tired of it, while others started liking it more because of how little the
  show actually cared, thus retaining it's controversial status. Also, <strong>fuck Slaine</strong>. </p>

  backstories in anime in a while, and having each and every last episode be tonally perfect in its depressing "nobody
  is in the wrong, and there are no winners or losers" presentation. It may have not been the Tokyo Ghoul we were
  expecting or wanting, but it managed to gracefully save itself in the end; even if some things got lost in all the
  chaos. As long as you don't come in expecting more of the first cour (like most of us did at first), then you should
  walk away pleased with this one.</p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">While many were disgusted by the first few episodes, I (RyomaNagare) have defended
  it as being a shameless grindhouse, and to be enjoyed for what it is.

  plots began to gel, the series became addictive. Sure, the setting makes absolutely no sense and every woman is a
  bisexual mech piloting sexbomb dressed in fetish wear, but in a brilliant twist the antagonist will break 4th wall and
  give you a reason for it. Your mind and pants will be blown away, if you can stomach Sunrise's inconsistent production
  values.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">If you came into <em>Log Horizon S2</em> expecting more of the same, or
  anything at all, you came into this show with a wrong perspective. While this season is still Log Horizon with it's
  interesting world and unique way of portraying MMOs, it lacks much of what made the first season great with boring
  plotlines, little development of the world and significantly worse art by studio Deen. Your mileage may vary with this
  one.</p>

<strong>Description: </strong>Anime habits have changed quite a bit in the past years. With the advent of the
  internet, many people rely on these Simulcast streaming services to watch anime because it's so convenient…. but not
  every show makes it across the pond, or these sites regardless of quality. Here's some shows you probably overlooked.
</p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Thoughts: </strong>Imagine your favorite long running shonen series. Now
  imagine all the filler removed, all the pointless soliloquies abridged, and you have <em>Nanatsu no Taizai.</em> In
  this show, every episode delivers a great fight, every episode raises the stakes, and the ending will leave you
  craving for more, while at the same time reaching a conclusion to a great climax. If this series was being simulcasted
  it would have been in must watch, so find the way and enjoy it.</p>

  managed to make it even more fun. Set in an alternate Earth where people around the world build model Gunpla and use
  them in simulated battles, Build Fighters is a massive crossover where Gunpla from across the franchise finally can
  meet head-on in battles. Build Fighters, as a subset of the Gundam franchise, has never been a serious entry in the
  series, but for what it lacked in thought-provoking dialogue, it made up with it in spades with incredible amounts of
  fun. The story of one team taking the world Gunpla Battle championship couldn't be more cliche, and yet the execution
  could make even a cynic crack a grin.</p>

  THE <em>iDOLM@STER: Cinderella Girls </em>is an adaptation of the spinoff mobile game of the same name, and as the

  overcome the various challenges of becoming successful entertainers. The cast becomes quite large and everyone gets
  some of the spotlight, though this does limit the extent of deep character development over the course of this 13

  delivers a romance that actually appears to be going somewhere. Thank <em>Kamisama</em>! Now we just need to hope it
  gets a season three.</p>

  get to experience a fun little journey worth taking. This show also contains the cutest octopus ever.</p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Have you ever wondered what would happen if Team Rocket were the good guys and Ash
  and the gang was the bad guys? <em>Yatterman Night</em> handles the inversion with it's universe's equivalent quite
  well, By executing juxtaposition in a way that engages the audience with both humor and drama, and it's a blast. That
  being said, while in the beginning it handles tone masterfully, it loses quite a bit of steam later on and it never
  gets back to that level. The last half feels like filler in comparison, and it never really makes a full comeback,
  just feeling average at times. Even with it's flaws though, I (Rockmandash12) really enjoyed this show, and I hope you
  do too. <strong>BANZAI! BANZAI! BANZAI!</strong></p>

  on a live action franchise, the story could have been a convoluted mess, but instead we got a streamlined prequel with
  a beautiful and original art direction, great soundtrack, and a concise story. Just when you may think you know where

  meta humor harem comedy show, if you're into that kind of stuff. Every episode has been quite amazing, with absolutely
  great character interactions, excellent execution of meta elements, and just well written comedy in general. All the

  a sure bet for fans of Kunihiko Ikuhara, director of <em>Revolutionary Girl Utena </em>and <em>Mawaru Penguindrum</em>.
  His third show is a modern fairy tale steeped in symbolism and rich visual language. It's a sweet and satisfying story
  about finding love and acceptance in the face of social pressure to blend in, but it also works as a scathing and
  incredibly clever commentary on cliches and problems with the yuri genre. Watch it! That's the sexy way, shabadadu.

  on the Season Overall</h4>
<img alt src="./1210873940541274915.png"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">I was genuinely surprised by how great this season was. Coming into these season
  with zero expectations, this season managed a high level of quality with almost every show and was enjoyable
  throughout. Yes, there wasn't a lot of shows this season, but the backlog from fall made up for it and pretty much
  every show in this season got really good.<em> - Rockmandash12</em></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Honestly, this
  was a great season. While at first it didn't seem to be so due to the drug which was Fall season, and that many of the
  new shows were unproven (such as Assassination Classroom, Death Parade, and Yatterman), it quickly proved its worth
  with great first episodes that got us talking and/or hooked on the series. This was definitely a season of pleasant
  surprises. <em>- The Messiah</em></p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Winter 2015 can lay claim to two of my favorite shows ever, <em>Parasyte</em> and
  <em>Shirobako</em>. Add to that a cavalcade of other shows that I would count as either good or great and you are left
  with a very memorable season.<em> - Kristof</em></p>
