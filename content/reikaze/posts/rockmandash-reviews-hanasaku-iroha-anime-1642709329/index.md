  Dex put <em>Hanasaku Iroha </em>in the Also Recommended section of the end card for our <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","http://anitay.kinja.com/glasslip-ani-tay-review-and-discussion-1641880502",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://anitay.kinja.com/glasslip-ani-tay-review-and-discussion-1641880502" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Glasslip</em> review</a></span> and I saw how much people liked it in the comments, I
  thought now would be a good time to check it out. Welcome to Rockmandash Reviews, and today we have a <em>Hanasaku
    Iroha</em>: a great PA Works show written by Mari Okada.</p>

<img alt src="./1248085436049238445.png"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Mari Okada is an amazing writer, and <em>Hanasaku Iroha</em> is yet another example of her
  great writing. The perfect balance of day to day activities, character interactions, interesting events, and well
  developed themes is really a sight to behold; this show is written well, and this balance will keep you interested.
</p>

<img alt src="./1248085436107547053.jpg"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><em>Hanasaku Iroha</em> follows Ohana Matsumae, a 16-year-old teenager living in
Tokyo, but Ohana has to move because her mother elopes with her boyfriend. Ohana arrives at her grandmother’s country
estate and realizes her grandma runs an inn called the Kissuisou. Ohana’s grandma starts making her work at the
Kissuisou but she finds herself at odds with many of the employees and customers at the inn. This discourages Ohana,
so she uses these circumstances as an opportunity to change herself for the better.</p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><em>Hanasaku Iroha</em> is slice of life done right: the daily events in it are much
  more interesting than most in this genre because it’s not just focused on a normal life, but something that’s
  different and unique. Just seeing how the staff of the Kissusiou keep the inn running, the antics they try to pull to
  get more customers, and how they deal with issues like large events is entertaining and kept me watching. On top of
  that, they pair those with great characters, and it makes it a slice of life that stands out from the crowd.</p>
<img alt src="./1248085436152323757.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">I can’t emphasize this enough: The characters are superb in <em>Hanasaku Iroha</em>.
  Ohana is probably the best main character I’ve ever seen in a slice of life show, and the rest of the cast is equally
  as great. The coming-of-age during the first episodes for Ohana was fantastic, and the themes she dealt with during
  that time were amazing and the themes she dealt with, such as loneliness, facing reality, the struggle to fit in, and
  dealing with the fact that effort doesn’t equal results were amazing and made me able to relate to her. When she
  changed herself, it was for the better: Ohana became a loud and overly optimistic lead who butted into many of the
  other characters’ problems, yet this personality never got on my nerves unlike many characters of that nature. Her
  quirks become strong points in the story and her actions, while annoying and reckless, always lead to the best
  situations. The rest of the cast is just as dynamic and interesting: they have eccentric personality traits and they
  all get fantastic development, with some of them even having whole episodes dedicated to developing it, with that info
  actually helping the story. If I spent time discussing every character and what development they went through, I’d be
  here all day talking about them because of how well the character development is executed. It’s what a good slice of
  life should do: spending time to flesh out the characters in an enjoyable way.</p>
<img alt src="./1248085436213579949.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">The interactions between the characters is one of the strong points of <em>Hanasaku
  Iroha</em>’s writing. The Kissusiou staff have some of the best chemistry I’ve seen in anime, leading to some
  interesting scenes. The bonds and feelings between the characters, along with their ideals of how they should live to
  achieve a happy life is something that is extremely enjoyable to watch as they run their course. The idea that the
  customer should always be the number one priority, the mentality of those who work in comparison to those who don’t,
  what one should dream for, what makes a successful team, the awkward relationship of a broken family that despises
  each other, the relationships between friends and coworkers, and of course, the relationships that lead to love are
  interesting, and engaging themes that were executed very well. Even the romantic sub-plot that felt shoehorned at
  times was handled pretty well: never overwhelming the main story and still being entertaining.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">If I had to say there was any flaws with this show, it has 2 of them: the middle parts of
  the show where it falls into the typical event-of-the-week type of show, and the direction at the beginning which was
  unclear. Both of these cause the plot and themes to falter, but the interesting interactions between the characters
  kept me watching. Really, Mari Okada is a stellar writer and this is another example why. It had good pacing, and it
  was entertaining throughout the show, especially at the end. It was a slice of life done right, and it shows that an
  interesting setting with interesting characters can go a long way.</p>

<img alt src="./1248085436276489389.jpg"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">I can pretty much copy and paste this segment for PA Works shows at this point: it’s a
beautiful show, just like everything they have made. They are called Progressive Animation for a reason: they manage
to blow you away with image quality every time you see one of the shows they made. Once again, the scenery is just
blows my mind; the episodes in Tokyo are absolutely stunning. It’s pretty much at Makoto Shinkai levels of <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryPorn",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryPorn" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">scenery porn</a></span> in those episodes, and it looks very pretty. They were my personal
favorite parts of the show visually as they make the city look amazing, yet they captured the look and feel of the
city from Ohana’s perspective. That’s a theme continues on; they really capture what a countryside would look like
(Probably because It’s inspired by a real place), and they capture the feel of the countryside with the great
lighting, insane detail, and the vivid greenery. However, there is a slight con due to this: the visuals don’t tend to
pop out that much in the show nearly as much as something like <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","Internal link","http://tay.kotaku.com/rockmandash-reviews-nagi-no-asukara-anime-1567969970",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://tay.kotaku.com/rockmandash-reviews-nagi-no-asukara-anime-1567969970"><em>Nagi no Asukara</em></a></span><em> </em>becauseit’s
more subdued and realistic, which is kind of a shame, but it helps the mood at the same time. </p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">I normally don’t really touch on them, but I thought that the character designs in
  <em>Hanasaku Iroha</em> were quite great because the characters have designs that work with their personalities. Ohana
  in general had a great design: Her hair with the flowers look amazing, no matter the expression she has on her face
  it’s pleasing to the eye, and the design really fits with her personality.</p><h4 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h110173"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>Visuals – 9.25/10</h4>

  big thing that separates this soundtrack from the other PA Works soundtracks: subtlety. The soundtrack in <em>Hanasaku
    Iroha</em> is made to compliment the mood, not to make the mood or atmosphere. Once you finally notice the
  soundtrack, you’ll be pleasantly surprised as it has well composed tracks, it utilizes a wide variety of instruments,
  it’s pleasing to the ear and it’s pretty great overall. As for voice acting, it’s pretty solid, but I’m not really an
  expert when it comes to voice acting so I can’t say much about it.</p>
<h4 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h110174"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>Sound - 8.5/10</h4>
<img alt src="./1248085436352335533.png"/>

<img alt src="./1248085436394128301.jpg"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Normally, with Okada stories, I have strong opinions on the stories she writes.
With <em>Hanasaku Iroha</em>, that’s not really the case. I’ve been saying it throughout the review; this show is very
subtle and what it’s trying to do, and this subtlety is something that makes me appreciate the show after the fact
more than while watching it. It gives it a feeling that this show was more planned than others, and I liked that.
However, this can be a flaw; the show was thoroughly enjoyable and found it to be great… but it doesn’t have the
passion I usually feel when dealing with Mari Okada works. I missed that, and I’m not exactly sure what to think of
the change, but I don’t think that’s the point with this show. This was a show that set out to be an enjoyable slice
of life and a feel good show, which it certainly does. It’s kinda like the <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://anitay.kinja.com/rockmandash-rambles-sakurasou-is-the-first-romantic-co-1603256720",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://anitay.kinja.com/rockmandash-rambles-sakurasou-is-the-first-romantic-co-1603256720" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Anti-Sakurasou</a></span> in execution, but they share a lot of similarities otherwise.
It’s an enjoyable ride that you’ll appreciate, but it’s not a story that’s memorable because of the emotions it
inflicted on you.</p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><em>Hanasaku Iroha</em> is a great show, but for reasons I did not expect. It’s one
  of the best slice of life shows I’ve seen, with a feel good attitude and subtlety that’s been forgotten in many shows.
  It does a lot right, and while it may not have the passion that I typically think of when I think of a Mari Okada
  work, it was still enjoyable, and I would definitely recommend this one.</p><h3 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h110176"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>Overall - 9/10, Polarization +.25, -1 </h3>
