Regardless of what you think about Sekai Project and the way they handle things, they are an increasingly important part of the Visual Novel scene and have been rattling off tons of announcements as of late. Today, Sekai Project announced that they would be localizing *Ame no Marginal,* a game made by Stage-Nana (the same people who did [*Narcissu*](https://rockmandash12.kinja.com/rockmandash-reviews-narcissu-1st-2nd-visual-novel-1676683203)*,* a game I liked quite a bit when I reviewed it).



Not much details are available yet, but through an [AMA with one of the translators from Sekai Project](http://www.reddit.com/r/visualnovels/comments/2u42g7/im_agilis_tler_for_narcissu_12_and_other_vns/), we've learned that Ame no Marginal is in the same vain as Narcissu: an utsuge with a similar tone, which is all good news to me. It'll be available on steam for $9.99 in mid-late 2015, with preorders starting now. You can expect a review coming from me in the future.
