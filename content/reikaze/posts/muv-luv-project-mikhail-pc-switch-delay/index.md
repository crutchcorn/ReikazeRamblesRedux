Unlike the previous entries in the _Muv-Luv_ series, which have been Visual Novels, _Project Mikhail_ is an action game where you control a Tactical Surface Fighter Mech to battle the alien BETA. Originally _Project Mikhail_ was set to come out on PC and mobile devices in April but is now the team will launch the new game on PC and Switch instead in August.
