At the end of every year, everyone seems to reminisce back on the events we witnessed, and we try to define the time that just passed in all sorts of ways. One such method is top lists and Awards, and here at AniTAY, we are not immune in this behavior. Returning from last year is The *AniTAY Anime Awards, *a collaborative effort by members in the AniTAY community to decide the best of the best of what 2017 had to offer, and we would love your help.

AniTAY has always been community first, and we always try to put our own community spin on these kinds of projects because the different opinions fed by the diversity of the community leads to better results. That’s why this Award process is open to everyone!

This article will cover the nominations selected by AniTAY members mucking around on a Google Docs sheet. While what we got here is pretty good, we can’t do this without everyone’s help! If you see anything missing or have any suggestions [fill out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfFTID83kA7-v3EbQp0S80PXW2QKyZR75n6CArlSfj80_zyFA/viewform?usp=sf_link) or post comments on the sheet and I’ll try to take suggestions and add it to the list. Suggestions will be closed on 1/8/2017.

Like last year, we’ll be running 2 awards, the Author’s Awards and the Reader’s Awards. This way we can keep our voice while including everyone in the process. Make your vote count by [filling this form here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfWLv6b2MOGUW1nDgTScNm8skFpBfa5GuC0lgwtbaO-lM5xmg/viewform?usp=sf_link). Voting will be closed 1/15/2017, when we release the results in a separate article.

Anyways, enough about the Awards, you’re here to see what we think: Here are the nominees! (Note: *Your Name* was pushed to this year’s awards so more people would have the opportunity to watch the film)
