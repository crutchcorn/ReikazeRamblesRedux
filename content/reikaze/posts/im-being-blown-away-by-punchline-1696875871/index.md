  what would you expect? I came into this show with a lot of mixed thoughts, but what I didn’t expect it to start with a
  bang, as a well executed (and crazy) show with amazing humor, one I would love. Kotarou Uchikoshi, You’ve done it
  again.</p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Really, you guys have to watch this show: I haven’t seen a show that made me laugh
  this hard in a long time, and <em>Punchline!</em> sinks you in like no tomorrow, doing everything extremely well. The
  show manages to get you to be entertained by being so absolutely over the top that it’s really quite ridiculous, but
  they way it pulls it’s punches is tight and focused, following every absurd action with an explanation so it’s not
  stupid all the time. It’s timing and pacing are absolutely perfect, and it keeps you entertained no matter what. The
  way it executes this absurd premise is actually a pretty smart at times, but you should really expect this, because,
  Uchikoshi. The punchlines are great, the writing is entertaining, the art is just amazing (seriously MAPPA is doing a
  great job. It’s really nice to have two Madhouses :P.), and everything about this show is just so well that it makes
  for an an experience that is just insane. It’s a show that gets you laughing, and keeps you laughing. it’s an amazing
</p>
<img alt src="./1312309564598705698.png"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">I’m really also just super surprised how much of Uchikoshi’s influence is really
  here, and how much it reminds me of his previous works. This show feels like it has homages to them, from that picture
  above that screamed <strong>EVER 17</strong> to how similar the cat Chiranouske is to Zero the 3rd but more enjoyable
  because you’re not supposed to hate his guts, this show is an Uchikoshi work, and it even has the sci -fi elements! am
  loving how much it feels like the other works I’ve seen of him. I fell in love with his works because of how well
  thought out they were, how well they used sci-fi, and even in a show with this stupid premise, they still manage to
  pull that off, which is very impressive. </p>
<img alt src="./1312309564660525858.png"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Even more impressively, the fanservice was handled really well! Yes, this isn’t a
  show you’ll want to watch in public (<strong>JAPANNNN!!!!!!!</strong>), and if you are a really prude person you still
  will be bothered by this, but if you’re watching this, they just play off the scenes in such a way you can’t help but
  laugh at them, you can’t take these seriously. Hell, I’m probably one of the most prude people on AniTAY but I still
  loved the hell out of it, as they were just handled really well. Sparkly effects, stupid scenarios, this show goes out
  of its way to make these scenes not really about fanservice, similar to <em>Kill la Kill,</em> and the effect works
  well. On that note, this show is very much so like <em>Kill la Kill</em>, with great character art from the great
  Shouta Iwasaki (who also did <em>Kill la Kil</em>l), a plot scenario where most people focus on the fanservice but
  isn’t really the main point, and it’s just so absurd that you can’t help but laugh. If you loved <em>Kill la Kill</em>,
  you’ll probably get something out of this as well. I’m personally enjoying this a lot more, but that’s a personal
  bias, really.</p>
<img alt src="./1312309564833656610.png"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">This show has cemented it’s place at the top of my guilty pleasures, even after one
  episode, and that’s saying something. It’s blown me away, in a way I’ve never been blown before... and I can’t help
  but appreciate everything about it. Honestly, go watch it now. It’s absurd, it’s stupid, it’s amazing, and you will
  not regret it.</p>
