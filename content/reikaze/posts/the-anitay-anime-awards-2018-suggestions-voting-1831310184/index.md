2018's been a wild ride, and along with it, so has anime. From the comfy *Yuru Camp* to the controversial *Goblin Slayer*, we’ve had a lot this year! Now that the year’s over though, it’s time to look back, and what better way to look back on the anime this year than our annual *AniTAY Anime Awards,*a collaborative effort by members in the AniTAY community to decide the best of the best!

AniTAY has always been community first, and we always try to put our own community spin on these kinds of projects because the different opinions fed by the diversity of the community leads to better results. That’s why this Award process is open to everyone!

This article will cover the nominations selected by AniTAY members mucking around on a Google Docs sheet. While what we got here is pretty good, we can’t do this without everyone’s help! If you see anything missing or have any suggestions [fill out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeuwe2CG8uPU8udvWFAwkKSRExVx2iAZpM9fXv0T2VK_nSw7w/viewform?usp=sf_link) or post comments on the sheet and I’ll try to take suggestions and add it to the list. Suggestions will be closed on 12/31/2018.

Like last year, we’ll be running 2 awards, the Author’s Awards and the Reader’s Awards. This way we can keep our voice while including everyone in the process. Make your vote count by [filling this form here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScQSXekRigWYrKX-JltN1uKZTaRV2I-1Ddbc75faVl_7eAzJw/viewform?usp=sf_link). Voting will be closed 1/13 /2019, when we release the results in a separate article.

There has been some slight changes to the formula this year however: we gave anime movies their own section, added a Slice of Life section, and a *Most Trash Show *Section. Hope you enjoy the tweaks and look forward to seeing your votes! Enough of my rambling, onto the nominees!
