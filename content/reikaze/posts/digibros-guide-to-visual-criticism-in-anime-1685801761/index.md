If you didn't know, I'm a pretty big fan of[ Digibro](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHhnf3RgHabfk5f2gUX6EVQ), as his anime analysis just is leagues ahead of people like the peasant anime reviewers like myself. Once again he does his magic, focusing on the way people analyze and grade visuals so if you do any anime reviewing, you deserve it to yourself to check it out, as all of his points are once again rock solid.\

Also on a side note, YouTube apparently hates anime YouTubers as Digibro's channel was seized in the very same way that [DouchebagChocolat's channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEeMTprAZaA) was, and this was only uploaded now because they finally gave his channel back... This shit has to stop...
