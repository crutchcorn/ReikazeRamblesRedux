<div><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><em>Midgar Studio </em>returns to Kickstarter with <em>Edge of Eternity:</em> a JRPG for
  PC and next gen consoles, utilizing an ATB battle system, a Sci-fi fantasy setting, and the reason I'm interested in
  it is a chance for a soundtrack by the legendary <strong>Yasunori Mitsuda, of</strong><em><strong> Chrono
    Trigger/Chrono Cross</strong></em><strong> fame!</strong></p>

  absolutely adore his soundtracks and can't wait for another game with an amazing soundtrack from him! I think it's a
  bit ambitious for what they are, but I hope for the best! It's been a while since we've seen an ATB based game, and I
  hope they do well. Kinda nervous though, it's a french dev doing a JRPG, it has visual issues to work out, and the
  involvement of him is only a goal, which the may not reach... anyways, Check out the Kickstarter over on <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/midgarstudio/edge-of-eternity-pc-mac-linux-ps4-xbox-one",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/midgarstudio/edge-of-eternity-pc-mac-linux-ps4-xbox-one" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">it's page.</a></span></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Note: edited this after reading the
