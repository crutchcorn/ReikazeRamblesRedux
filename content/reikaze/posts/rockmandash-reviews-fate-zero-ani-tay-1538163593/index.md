  we have the 2012 anime known as <em>Fate/Zero</em>. <em>Fate/Zero</em> was created by a group of people with
  unbelievable talent and heralded as one of the best anime of the year....but can the clash of ideals replace actual
  character development?</p>

  <em>Fate/Zero</em> of course! <em>Fate Zero</em> was written by Gen Urobuchi, and Gen takes a very interesting
  approach to the Nasuverse, but one that blends in with the rest of the Nasuverse very well. <em>Fate/Zero</em> is the
  predecessor to <em>Fate/stay night</em>, and takes place during the 4th Holy grail war (which isn’t really a war....)
  where people known as Masters fight with Heroes throughout history, known as servants, for a chance to get the Holy
  Grail, which grants their wishes. Each servant is one of the 7 classes, Saber, Archer, Lancer, Berserker, Rider,
  Assassin, and Caster. If you didn’t get that, well, <em>Fate/Zero</em> includes an extremely long 45 minute first
  episode that’s almost nothing but exposition, and exposition on pretty much every topic. It’s a well written, polished
  plot, with interesting themes, great ideas, and amazing premise. One issue I came into is that <em>Fate/Zero</em> has
  some pacing issues. <em>Fate/Zero</em> tries to be both an action show yet have a dark, and conversational plot, and
  these interfere with each other. The pacing is much better than KnK (having a plot in order helps a lot), but still
  it’s still slow at the beginning.</p>

<img alt src="./1313360469629133091.png"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Normally when I review, I usually clump plot and characters into one category known
  as Writing. I decided to change it up, because I have a pretty polarized view on the characters. This is because in my
  eyes, a good majority of characters represent ideals and all conflicts are those characters fighting because of the
  difference between ideals, and they are lacking in development. This is possible because <em>Fate/Zero</em> has an
  ensemble cast which focuses on all the characters, yet focuses on none. They all have interesting ideals, but due to
  the ensemble cast, they don’t develop them enough, and to me, it feels like wasted potential. They run with the
  conflict, but they never go deeper into what these ideals stand for like in <em>F/SN</em>, and because the character
  pretty much represent the ideals, they feel hollow. </p>
<img alt src="./1313360469700538147.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Due to the ensemble cast and focus on ideals, there are only a few characters I was
  attached to, and truly enjoyed. The only original characters that get any development are Rider and Waiver. Rider is
  epic, always brings up the mood and is so charismatic that every time he’s on the screen, you cannot help but look at
  him. Waiver is Rider’s master, and is a dynamic character with amazing development as he grows from a spineless wimp
  to one who you can relate to, yet admire for his actions. Depending on who you are, You might like this approach with
  ensemble characters to focus on the action, but I wish it had more time to flesh in the characters, and more
  focus.</p><h4 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h119786"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>Characters - 7.5/10</h4>

<img alt src="./1313360470038798115.png"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Ufotable does it once again. <em>Fate/Zero </em>has some of the best visuals in
  anime, with absolutely beautiful visuals: Visuals that are so good, that people still debate that they haven’t been
  surpassed yet. In my eyes, what <em>Fate/Zero</em> does really well in the visuals is the is the fight scenes, with
  fluid animation and excellent consistency. <em>Fate/Zero</em> has some of the best fight scenes in anime, in my
  opinion, and as a Fate fan, it’s great to see characters I love animated so beautifully. It’s one of the best looking
  anime I’ve seen, and it’ll hold up for years.</p>

Just like
  Kara no Kyoukai, this series is full of epic music that is pleasing to the ear and absolutely beautiful, once again
  made by Yuki Kajiura. It’s truly excellent music, this time with a nice orchestral sound. They use it extremely well,
  with each track sounding awesome and supporting the show at the same time. The superb voice acting helps make up for
  that a bit though as all the characters had great voices and they all did a great job. As for the eternal Dub vs Sub
  debate, I’m going to have to give this to Dub, but the voice work is fantastic no matter what language you’re watching
  this in. While the sub has the returning characters from other Fate works, I felt like the dub cast did a better job
  in representing the characters. (Especially the servants, who are mostly foreign to Japan anyways.)</p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">While I did enjoy <em>Fate/Zero</em>, I didn’t like it nearly as much as the rest of
  the Type-Moon universe. and I blame that to <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hype backlash</a></span>, and a lack of
  personality, which I talk about in my <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","http://rockmandash12.kinja.com/rockmandash-rambles-fate-zero-revisited-1637549445",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://rockmandash12.kinja.com/rockmandash-rambles-fate-zero-revisited-1637549445" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">revisited article</a></span>.

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">About the hype backlash; I heard so much coming into this that I was expecting
  something amazing, and what I saw was pretty good; but not as good as I was expecting. I heard so many saying it’s the
  best show ever, but that never clicked with me. I gave it plenty of chances, but it really didn’t engage me. My
  biggest gripe is the lack of character development throughout the series. I really don’t care for a good majority of
  the characters, because how they are embodiments of ideals instead of fleshed out characters with personalities.
  Because of this distinct lack of character development, episodes with it like Rin’s Big Adventure (Rin, EP 10),
  Distant Memories (EP 18) &amp; Where Justice Swells (EP 19) are the peaks for me, if the show was like this the whole
  time, I’d love it. If you are looking for something that grips you , you aren’t going to find that here.</p><h4 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h119789"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>Enjoyment - 7.5/10</h4>
<img alt src="./1313360470518411811.png"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Fate/Zero is a fantastic show, as it’s polished as all hell and is a good watch. The
  show is epic and has some really good points, and many fans will love it, but I have a few gripes with it and I just
  can’t love it as much as you guys do.</p><h2 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h119790"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>Overall - 8.75/10,
