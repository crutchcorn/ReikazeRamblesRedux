</aside><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> To give you a <strike>brief</strike> summary, Corpse party follows a group of
  students that decide to perform a charm called "Sachiko Ever After" which enables them to be friends forever if they
  do it right. They don't (of course, we wouldn't have a story if they did it right), and they are sent to an alternate
  universe that contains the Heavenly Host Elementary School, an elementary school that was torn down but is haunted by
  the ghosts of the school's murdered children in this dimension. The students try to find their way home and figure out
  the truth to this mystery but things don't always go to plan. Due to it being a horror, several of them die and it
  doesn't really end on a pretty note. The game had many bad ends through the game (one of them leading to a spin-off
  called Book of Shadows), but <em>Tortured Souls</em> only follows the true end.</p>

<img alt src="./1032601978022846123.jpg"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><em>Corpse Party: Tortured Souls</em> is a very interesting adaptation. While I'd
  personally recommend experiencing <em>Corpse Party</em> via the game because <em>Tortured Souls</em> has to rush the
  story and it has quite a different direction, it uses what little time it has well by portraying what people would
  expect from something called <em>Corpse Party</em>. What I mean by that is a lot of Corpses, gore, horror, gore,
  supernatural elements, gore, psychological damage, gore, horrible deaths, gore, and a killer soundtrack. Did I mention
  Gore? Yeah... there's a lot of that, making it absolutely perfect for Project Hydra, with the amazing reactions. It's
  a horror slasher film in anime format, and it laughs at the idea of subtlety. Everything's notched up to 11, and if
  you thought <em>Elfen Lied</em> and <em>Higurashi</em> was gory.... you are in for a treat. Now that you are in the
  right mindset for these reviews/reactions, let's get this started!</p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> In the respective <strike>chopping</strike> order, we have Krakken_Unleashed,
  Protonstorm, Messiah, and thatsmypizza <strike>dying</strike> watching this show and then writing up a quip for
  Project Hydra. As for the formatting for the Project Hydra for <em>Corpse Party: Tortured Souls</em>, I decided that
  I'd do it differently than the way Exile did the formatting for our first Project Hydra article, <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://anitay.kinja.com/anitay-presents-project-hydra-versus-tenchi-muyo-1667362501",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://anitay.kinja.com/anitay-presents-project-hydra-versus-tenchi-muyo-1667362501" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Tenchi Muyô</em></a></span>. Instead of lumping them in one article, I thought it
  would be better if we released them one per day, as a separate article, and this article will serve to link to them.
  Please post feedback on thoughts for which you would prefer, as Project Hydra is very much a work in progress.</p>
