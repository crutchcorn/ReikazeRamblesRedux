  this list, you may ask? If it aired/released this season, it can go on this list. I don’t see the point in only giving
  a show one chance during it’s airing season, and this is my list so I’ll list my favorite shows regardless of what
  season it started on. If this means that one show hogs the top spot for 2 seasons, than good for that show! If it’s an
  OVA or movie that came out during the duration of the season I fell in love with (<strong>*cough*</strong>
<strong><em>AKITO THE EXILED</em> *cough*</strong>), then it may be there. I think that the seasonal split is
  arbitrary and unnecessary, so it’s completely gone here. Sorry about that, but that’s how I’m doing it.</p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Plot Description: </strong>Half a year after the turmoil that rocked the
  entire city of Ikebukuro, peace has once again returned to the city, and people are living each day normally. The high
  school students enjoy their days of youth as the strongest and most dangerous man of Ikebukuro works diligently. The
  informant plots (or plans) a new scheme and the headless rider is pursued by the cops as she rides through the
  night... But soon this normal will be cut short by the abnormal. Slowly but surely, the unknown will seize the city
  and face an all new storm. <em>- Plot Description from MAL</em></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Justification
  &amp; Thoughts: </strong>Uh, If you know anything about my tastes, you would know that <em>Durarara!!</em> is one of
  my favorite shows ever so of course it would be here .. so yeah! Seeing it back again was like seeing an old childhood
  friend for the first time in a few years: Of course, it’s not at the point where it’s at it’s best and the
  interactions are still awkward, but it’s still really nice to see and it’s still just as fun and enjoyable as it
  always was. Really, <em>Durarara!! X2</em> started a bit slow at the beginning, and episode 7 was an absolutely a mess
  in animation, but that’s really OK because it has plenty of time to get back to the level to get back, it’s a new
  studio so of course there’s going to be some growing pains, and most importantly, it still does everything <em>Durarara!!</em>
  S1 did great. It’s still the <em>Durarara!!</em> that people love, and I’m still enjoying the hell out of it. Looking
  forward to the new seasons! (Not the wait though... Tri-split cour??? &gt;_&gt;) For more of my thoughts on
  Durarara!!, check out my <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","http://anitay.kinja.com/rockmandash-reviews-durarara-anime-1665959528",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://anitay.kinja.com/rockmandash-reviews-durarara-anime-1665959528" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">S1 review</a></span>, and S2 review when

  Mention #2/Guilty Pleasure: <em>Aldnoah.Zero Season 2</em></h3>
<img alt src="./1417776969153217680.png"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Plot Description: </strong><em>Aldnoah.Zero</em> pretty much consists of
  getting <strong>SLAINED </strong>over and over again. That’s pretty much all you need to know, but if you <strong>REALLY </strong>want
  to know, here’s a real description:</p>
<blockquote class="sc-8hxd3p-0 nvIqO" data-type="BlockQuote"><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">In 1972, the Apollo 17
  mission found a hypergate to Mars on the surface of the moon. Upon landing, astronauts discovered an enchanted utility
  later referred to as “Aldnoah,” giving the astronauts a status of superiority. Soon, many humans have relocated to
  Mars, and have adapted to the name “Martians.” After Princess Asseylum, a royal Martian princess, descends onto Earth
  in an attempt to create a treaty between both planets, a war breaks out between Earth and Mars, and Martian soldiers
  begin to descend from the sky, riding steel giants, intent on exterminating humanity. - Plot Description From MAL</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Justification &amp; Thoughts: No, I am not recommending this show. </strong><em>Aldnoah.Zero </em>has
  to be one of the worst shows I have came to adore, and my experience with it is very love/hate, similar to <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","Internal link","http://tay.kotaku.com/school-days-hq-the-tay-review-1594674728",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://tay.kotaku.com/school-days-hq-the-tay-review-1594674728">School Days</a></span>. From the start I never
  had the highest expectations for <em>Aldnoah.Zero</em>, saying that it’s been horrible since the start while people
  were still saying it’s the best thing since sliced bread, but S2 has redeemed itself from the garbage that was Season
  1 by managing to be pretty fucking enjoyable, something that was totally absent from S1 for me. It does this by taking
  a step a notch into absurdity: It’s no longer the train wreck that you can’t stop staring at, it’s escalated to North
  Korea levels of attention grabbing, stupidity and absurdity... it’s so amazing and I can’t help but watching. It’s
  earned it’s spot as one of my top guilty pleasures, it’s a show I love to hate, it’s one of the most interesting
  trolls seen in anime, and I just can’t stop watching... <strong>God damnit. </strong>Check out Koda’s review of <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","http://anitay.kinja.com/aldnoah-zero-the-ani-tay-review-1637330529",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://anitay.kinja.com/aldnoah-zero-the-ani-tay-review-1637330529" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Aldnoah.Zero S1</a></span>,

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Plot Description: </strong>After death, humans are either sent to the void
  or reincarnated. But for some, at the instant of their death, they arrive at Quindecim, a bar attended by the

  make for a great watch, and <em>Death Parade </em>is a really quality w as expected from Madhouse. The reason it’s at
  5? The rest of the list is just that good, and it squandered it’s potential at the beginning so I really didn’t care
  for it too much. (The first 2 episodes got me expecting a <em>Zero Escape</em> type of thing, but what I got was an
  episodic game story so I was really disappointed...)

</h3>
<img alt src="./1417776969335555984.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Plot Description: </strong>The 17-year-old Izumi Shinichi lives with his
  mother and father in a quiet neighborhood in Tokyo. One night, worm-like aliens called Parasytes invade Earth, taking
  over the brains of human hosts by entering through their ears or noses. One Parasyte attempts to crawl into Shinichi’s
  ear while he sleeps, but fails since he is wearing headphones, and enters his body by burrowing into his arm instead,
  taking over his right hand and is named Migi.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Because Shinichi was able to prevent
  Migi from traveling further up into his brain, both beings retain their separate intellect and personality. As the duo
  encounter other Parasytes, they capitalize on their strange situation and gradually form a strong bond, working
  together to survive. This gives them an edge in battling other Parasytes, who frequently attack the pair upon
  realization that Shinichi’s human brain is still intact. Shinichi feels compelled to fight other Parasytes, who devour
  humans as food, while enlisting Migi’s help. - <em>Plot Description from MAL</em></p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Justification &amp; Thoughts: </strong><em>Parasyte</em> is a roller
  coaster, one that may feel off to anyone paying attention to how it deviates from the original, but as one who doesn’t
  know anything about the source at all, I enjoyed the ride, quite a bit. It’s fast yet managed pace pretty great show,
  being well executed, well animated, and engaging throughout. From it’s great pacing, to the interesting premise and
  engaging characters, it’s a show that’s consistently entertaining, very satisfying, and a show you won’t want to miss.
  The reason why it’s where it is on this list is because there were times this season that didn’t nearly grab my
  attention and engage me as it did early on, a lot of aspects in the second half felt pretty rushed and the dubstep
  still bothers me, but otherwise it was a great show that anyone should enjoy. Don’t dismiss it because it’s from an
  older manga, it’s still pretty great!

  Shirobako</em></h3>
<img alt src="./1417776969368186000.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Plot Description:</strong> I find that most summaries out there about <em>Shirobako</em>
  are a bit deceiving and don’t actually represent what happens in the show, stating that<em> Shirobako</em> is the
  story of five girls who, after making a short anime while members of their high school animation club, promise to come
  back together as adults and make their own full anime. I believe that, it’s the story of everyone involved in <em>Shirobako </em>trying
  to do their best, to succeed with their goals, usually involving the creation of anime. While the 5 girls do make an
  appearance in the story and are what the story starts with, they are just a piece of the puzzle, a part of the grand
  scheme, and it actually focuses more on the struggles of the animation studio Musashino, and the people there. <em>-

  Thoughts: </strong>The best anime about anime you will ever see has been just quite amazing this season, being
  extremely informative, and very entertaining. <strike><em>Animation: The Animation</em></strike><em> Shirobako</em>
  may not be everyone’s cup of tea, but I absolutely adored it, and everything about it. It really made me appreciate
  all the things that the people making anime have to deal with, and to get this peek into the world of animation is
  something I really like. It’s also an entertaining slice of life show as well, and I just love the characters and
  interactions which really add a lot to the show to make it enjoyable, so it’s been nothing but good times for me, even
  enjoying the time I spent thinking about how the people making this show had to deal with the things it was talking

  amazing.
