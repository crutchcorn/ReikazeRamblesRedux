  short kinetic novel published by Sekai project. It’s exactly what it says on the tin, but with a twist: it’s a love
  story about a guy who falls in love with a girl at first sight, it just happens that the girl that our MC falls in
  love with happens to be a cyclops! What??? While I appreciated the pun in the title, that appreciation doesn’t mean I
  fell in love with it at first sight, or really the rest of the game in general.</p>

<img alt src="./1285895472463778220.png"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">To be more specific about the story, it’s about as generic as you can get. Our MC (Mamarou)
  is a transfer student who has two friends, who make up 2 of the 6 characters in this story. One day, he hears sobbing
  and meets the shy and bullied Sachi Usui, who just happens to have one gigantic eye. That being said, the
  disappointment starts off right off the bat: while <em>Love at First Sight</em> does what a good love story should do
  decently, the writing has no defining traits, nothing special at all. This is a tried and true story we’ve all seen
  before, and if you’ve seen any romance story, you’ve seen this before. This may not be an issue to some because
  entertaining enough so it doesn’t feel like you’ve been wasting your time, but there’s nothing that makes this game
  stand out from the crowd, and the writing shouldn’t be the reason you buy this. The only conflict in the story comes
  and goes in minutes, and the romance is just another typical shy girl romance. This extends to the characters too:
  while entertaining for the most part, you’ve seen them all before, and they are pretty straightforward, nothing
  special. The most developed character is Sachi’s aunt for heaven’s sake, and she’s not even there that long.<br/></p>

<img alt src="./1285895472663298476.png"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Also, if you are buying this game because of the novelty factor of our heroine Sachi being
  a cyclops, it never really comes into the play during the story. <em>Love at First Sight</em> is just a slice of life
  love story, nothing more, nothing less, and considering that she’s a cyclops, it’s pretty baffling they can pull this
  off. If you’re curious on why she’s a cyclops, how that even works, any of her background, or anything… you are out of
  luck here. The character’s reactions don’t change, there is no event focused on it, nothing. Hell, the fact that she’s
  a bullied girl plays a more important role than her being a cyclops! The game’s selling factor isn’t even a part of
  the story, and that’s a pretty big disappointment.</p>

<img alt src="./1285895472765130412.jpg"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Really, the novelty factor that she’s cyclops is the main reason you’d pick this up, and it
  only shows in the only notable thing about this game, the visuals of the game. Frankly, I’m pretty mixed about it, but
  I do appreciate what they were going for. The art style really isn’t my cup of tea with its dark and rough design, but
  it’s a unique art style to say the least, and it’s nice to see something deviate from the norm. The art adds character
  to an otherwise unremarkable visual novel, and I probably wouldn’t have read through the whole game, which is pretty
  noteworthy, considering it’s only 2 hours. The music in comparison though, is nothing special. No memorable tracks,
  and it’s pretty subdued. It’s not something you’ll notice unless you’re looking for it, which is a bit disappointing
  to say the least.</p>

<img alt src="./1285895472975510700.png"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Really though, all of this lead to the question that I had in my mind the whole time I
  played through this game: What the hell, Sekai Project? Why would you support yet another novelty VN that nobody
  really asked for, and why would you price it at 10 dollars? Steam’s full of novelty VNs that are much cheaper, and
  there’s nothing that makes this worth that much, nothing that I would personally pay this much for. If this was
  something that the dev wanted to do for fun and release for the sake of it, I could give that a pass if it was free or
  relatively cheap, but 10 dollars? This is a 2 hour game that doesn’t justify that price tag at all, and it just
  baffles my mind that they would price it that high. Yes, it’s an entertaining read, and it’s not a particularly bad
  visual novel, but for the price they are commanding for, don’t bother. If you’re interested, pick it up on a steam
  sale or something.</p>
