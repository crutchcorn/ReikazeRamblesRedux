  Dating Sims and Visual Novels are technically different genres and are not interchangeable terms. For more

  (well, loosely copied, I edited it a bit for flow in this article):<br/></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong><em>Visual
  Novels</em> </strong>(<strong>VN</strong> for Short) is a subgenre of adventure games and are interactive storytelling
  games, usually structured around choose your own adventure books where the player is presented with choices that may
  or may not alter the course of the story. They are commonly illustrated in an anime/manga art style and are primarily
  text focused. Character sprites, original soundtracks, voice acting are common occurrences in more modern games. </p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Dating Sims </strong>are technically different genres, being a sub-genre of
  sim (simulation) games based on romantic relationships. Dating sims include a gameplay element and often a skill
  set<strong> </strong>which allows you to raise specific stats to win over the different heroines.</p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">While there may be cases that there are games that have both, but for the most part
  they are separate genres, and there is no such thing as <em>Dating Sim Visual Novel</em>. There are <em>Romance Visual
    Novels</em>, and visual novels with dating, but look up any article talking about VN terminology, and they are
  usually noted as separate entities because they have completely different mechanics and different goals. For an
  example, Wikipedia’s <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_novel",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_novel" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Visual Novel page specifically says not to be confused with Dating sims</a></span>,
  Their dating sim page states <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dating_sim",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dating_sim" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“For the adventure subgenre that is also often referred to as dating sim, see visual novel”</a></span>,
  and <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","http://www.examiner.com/article/lexicon-part-three-visual-novels-and-dating-sims",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://www.examiner.com/article/lexicon-part-three-visual-novels-and-dating-sims" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this examiner article also explicitly states a difference in the genres</a></span>
  for an example. Yes, I know these aren’t the best sources and you’re going to discredit what i’m saying because of my
  sources, that’s fair, but I’d appreciate if you could link some more “Legit” sources as there isn’t really any
  definitive source to talk about terminology regarding VNs.<br/></p>
<img alt src="./vjev4d9rahdekwtkuttx.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">There may be times when a game is both like <em>Hatoful Girlfriend </em>(Idk about
  that one, personally haven’t played it but from what I’ve seen it’s mostly just a traditional VN), but I’d argue that
  even if it was thoroughly intertwined in the game, it doesn’t mean that the genres are one in the same. Genres aren’t
  in total isolation, and other genres do interact,people don’t typically say that one is a part of another and your
  example doesn’t doesn’t mean that Dating Sims <strong>ARE</strong> Visual Novels or vice-versa. <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9RMGFUyMY",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT9RMGFUyMY" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Super Paper Mario</em></a></span> is a platformer and an RPG for an example, but those
  two genres have different mechanics and nobody would say that they are the same because there are games with both.
  Yet, people always do this with VNs and dating sims, and that doesn’t really make sense when you look into it. If you
  disagree after this article, that’s fine, but please take a moment to try to consider the thought that they aren’t one
  and the same.</p>
