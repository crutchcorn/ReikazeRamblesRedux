<div><img alt src="vrrlgbgrvdumjgjdxwxa.jpg"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">As an avid fan of retro gaming (especially on original hardware), <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://www.emuparadise.me/emuparadise-changing.php",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://www.emuparadise.me/emuparadise-changing.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Emuparadise</a></span>’s decision to take their ROMs down and the discussions that have
  followed have a left a lot of mixed thoughts in my mind. I thought I’d throw my two cents about the whole situation,
  as well as clarifying some things that you may not understand about the state of retro gaming with original
  hardware.<br/></p>

  Nintendo and Emuparadise</h2>
<img alt src="qj7cayc1cow27rd6fkwx.png"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Let’s start with the most important part of this whole debate- <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://www.howtogeek.com/262758/is-downloading-retro-video-game-roms-ever-legal/",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://www.howtogeek.com/262758/is-downloading-retro-video-game-roms-ever-legal/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Distributing ROMs is illegal, period</a></span>. The legality of ROMs and emulators
  themselves are a different story (Dumping ROMs for personal use is in a legal grey zone and Emulators are legal), but
  it’s pretty clear cut that distribution of ROMs is illegal.<br/></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Nintendo or any other
  company have all the right in the world to pursue legal action on these distributors - they’re still profiting on many
  of these games successors or VC options, and even if they aren’t, they still have their IP to defend. I think it’s
  fairly ironic that Nintendo is the one trying so hard to stop piracy when their consoles are some of the easiest to
  pirate with and they put so little effort into making their devices secure (see FreeShop), but it is what it is.</p>

<img alt src="./z9jjxqfvoihbwel7g6np.jpg"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">In regards to Emuparidise, you might disagree with their decision to take their
  ROMs down especially because we don’t know if they were directly pressured to do so, but their actions are pretty
  defendable and easy to understand too. Since Nintendo is on the right side of the law, they would most likely win a
  suit and the amount that they’re asking for (<span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://torrentfreak.com/nintendo-sues-console-rom-sites-for-mass-copyright-infringement-180720/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Torrentfreak+%28Torrentfreak%29",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://torrentfreak.com/nintendo-sues-console-rom-sites-for-mass-copyright-infringement-180720/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Torrentfreak+%28Torrentfreak%29" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$2M for each Trademark infringement and $150K for each Nintendo game</a></span>)
  would risk the livelihood of the team, as the founder MasJ explains:</p>
<blockquote class="sc-8hxd3p-0 nvIqO" data-type="BlockQuote"><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">It’s not worth it for us to
  risk potentially disastrous consequences. I cannot in good conscience risk the futures of our team members who have
  contributed to the site through the years. We run EmuParadise for the love of retro games and for you to be able to
  revisit those good times. Unfortunately, it’s not possible right now to do so in a way that makes everyone happy and
  keeps us out of trouble.</p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">This is an extremely emotional decision for me after running this site for so many
    years. But I believe it is the right thing for us at this point of time.</p></blockquote>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Being mad at either of these groups is not helping anyone, and both of these groups
  were in the right. Ultimately this sucks for fans of retro games though: Sure, there’s other places to get ROMs and
  games, but Emuparadise was one of the best distribution platforms with lots of abandonware, and no viruses and adware
  like so many other sites. They provided an easy way to access games that would much harder to get otherwise, and now
  they’re gone.</p>
<hr class="gcp5ez-1 egkUKA"/><h3 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h98659"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>About
  Piracy &amp; Game Preservation</h3>
<img alt src="mo7gl84ynpljy6ccqklg.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">There’s one quote that’ll always ring in my mind about piracy, and it’s still
  relevant now:<br/></p>
<blockquote class="sc-8hxd3p-0 nvIqO" data-type="BlockQuote"><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">“<em>Piracy is almost always
  a service problem and not a pricing problem.</em>“- Gabe Newell﻿<br/></p></blockquote>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">The reason so many people flock to solutions like Emuparadise is simply put because
  they provide a much better solution than the alternative. Even for games that aren’t super obscure like <em>GoldenEye
    007</em>, you’d have to get an n64 because nothing’s BC with N64(and it isn’t on VC) then and you’d have to either
  go to a retro game store or go online to eBay and pick it up - which is much more annoying than just downloading an
  emulator and ROM, then playing it on your PC. Hell, there are people in <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://mashable.com/2017/08/20/nintendo-iran-club/#urKV7Yyt6iqd",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://mashable.com/2017/08/20/nintendo-iran-club/#urKV7Yyt6iqd" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">certain regions like Iran</a></span>
  where game companies aren’t even supported, and they have no legal way of buying very common games other than
  importing or from third parties. <br/><br/>Seeing these games go down is a bummer because the industry hasn’t done a
  good job of archiving games - if every NES, SNES, N64, SMS, TG16, GEN, SAT, DC, etc game was available on like the
  Switch eShop for an example, I doubt many people would be nearly as upset as they are now. These games are a key part
  of the history that this industry builds, and to see them be that much harder to access is a tragedy.</p>
<div class="ooo3c9-0 PpIMM align--bleed has-video media-large video-embed embed-frame"><span class="flex-video widescreen"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ffngZOB1U2A" width="560"></iframe><span class="js_recommend" data-chomp-id="ffngZOB1U2A" data-recommend-id="youtube://ffngZOB1U2A" data-recommended="false" id="youtube-ffngZOB1U2A"></span></span></div><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">That being said, game preservation doesn’t necessarily go hand in hand with piracy and
  piracy shouldn’t be looked at as the only method of preserving these games. Companies like GOG put a lot of effort to
  make abandonware up to date and available legally, and if you aren’t familiar with what they’ve done, check out this
  documentary out if interested. Here’s hoping that groups like Emuparadise use this opportunity to make console games
  more accessible on modern platforms, to keep the idea of game preservation alive, in a more legal manner.</p>

<hr class="gcp5ez-1 egkUKA"/><h2 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h98660"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a><strong>So,
  About How Much Harder...</strong> </h2>
<img alt src="e7iddeirdgqujweexlbq.png"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">All that being said though, there’s been a lot of misinformation in the wake of all
  this news about how hard it is to play these games in a legal manner, and that’s been bothering me quite a bit. It’s
  not impossible, it’s not inherently expensive, it’s not a waste of time because of the inherent age of the systems and
  it is not impossible to play on original hardware in high quality.</p>
<img alt src="ij5qm6wryzvzpnabjl4e.png"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">While some poorly sold cult classics games like <em>Snatcher </em>and
  <em>Earthbound</em> are getting so expensive to the point in which it makes absolutely no sense to buy them, you can
  get many retro games for fairly cheap and pretty easily in a legal manner. Obviously there’s emulation boxes like the
  NES &amp; SNES Mini that have a compilation of games and you can get many online like PS1 games on the PSN store, but
  even buying the original carts is reasonably cheap. Even great games like <em>Legend of Zelda: Link to the Past</em>
  for SNES is about 20 dollars to get, and many games are about that ball park or less (fun fact, my friend <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://twitter.com/crutchcorn",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://twitter.com/crutchcorn" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">@crutchcorn</a></span> <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://www.facebook.com/FairGameRetro/photos/a.633159503386168.1073741826.435680173134103/1789448527757254/?type=3&amp;theater",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://www.facebook.com/FairGameRetro/photos/a.633159503386168.1073741826.435680173134103/1789448527757254/?type=3&amp;theater" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">got 50+ copies of<em> Sonic 2 </em>for Game Gear </a></span>because

  many copies that they struck a deal with him to get rid of em). There’s so many cheap games out there that you can
  have a great time and not pirate anything, and they’ll look great on your shelf in the process.</p>
<img alt src="bfk7bsghfidntb7pf9ft.png"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Playing your original games isn’t really an issue too: If you don’t mind emulation,
  there’s great systems like the <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga="[false]" href="https://smile.amazon.com/Hyperkin-RetroN-Console-not-machine-specific/dp/B00DZIX3CQ/ref=sr_1_1?ascsubtag=db64892324f1887fb0bcf2f0663ff39fc21261d7&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=retron 5&amp;qid=1533878649&amp;s=videogames&amp;sr=1-1&amp;tag=kinja-20" target="_blank">Retron 5</a></span> that’ll allow you to play multiple systems
  in one box in HD, and if you’re a sucker for original hardware like me, then those aren’t all that expensive either: A
  Sega Genesis costs about 20 bucks to get, a PS2 costs about 50 dollars, a Dreamcast costs about 40 dollars (Everyone
  reading this, buy a Dreamcast it’s great), etc.<br/></p>
<div class="ooo3c9-0 PpIMM align--bleed has-video media-large video-embed embed-frame"><span class="flex-video widescreen"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LOSQgBEf5ac" width="560"></iframe><span class="js_recommend" data-chomp-id="LOSQgBEf5ac" data-recommend-id="youtube://LOSQgBEf5ac" data-recommended="false" id="youtube-LOSQgBEf5ac"></span></span></div><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">If you’re worried about these consoles failing because of their age, I really wouldn’t be -
  first of all these consoles are pretty reliable or can be repaired for fairly cheap, but more importantly many people
  in the retro community are hard at work trying to preserve these consoles. With the older consoles, a lot of work has
  gone into what we call FPGA consoles - these are systems that can perfectly replicate the way that the original
  hardware worked and pipe them out in glorious HD. For newer, CD based systems, many groups have made alternatives to
  CDs that allow you to load games on hardware that’s less prone to failure: you can run games off of an SD card for

  crap, that’s absolutely not the case. By default with the composite cables you’re probably hooking the systems up
  with, original hardware can look pretty bad on a modern TV thanks to bad scaling or improper handling of the 240p
  image these consoles put out, but hook them up with high quality RGB systems and these consoles can shine. My Life In
  Gaming has a great series about how to get great video quality out of original consoles, and you should definitely
  check it out. That being said - you don’t have to go full Framemeister like they do and still get great video quality:
  you can get a cheap CRT and hook everything up with SVideo and games will look pretty great, you could hook up stuff
  through SCART and get a cheaper HDMI scaler or a SCART to Component transcoder, or you can get stuff like the <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://www.hdretrovision.com/",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://www.hdretrovision.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">HD Retrovision</a></span> cables
  that’ll go through component, which most modern TVs should have. <br/><br/>All of this means that retro gaming on
  original hardware with original copies is a viable option, and just because ROMs are less available doesn’t mean retro
  gaming is no longer feasible. Many people in the retro gaming community have poured a lot of effort into preserving
  and improving the experience of playing on these consoles, and to say that ROMs are the only option to get into retro
  gaming is doing a great disservice to everyone in the community. These are my thoughts on the situation, and feel free
  to comment and talk about your opinions in regards to ROMs, Emulation and the whole Emuparadise situation :)<br/></p>
