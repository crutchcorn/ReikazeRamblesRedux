  right? The Summer 2016 season just ended, and like always, I’ve compiled a list of what I think are the best. Welcome
  to Rockmandash’s Top Anime of Summer 2016!</p>

  on the Season Overall</h3>
<img alt src="./p3iwtin0y2uuklf91ewd.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">After coming off of the fantastic winter and spring seasons of anime, one may get
  their hopes up for summer... but dreams remained dreams as they got meh. Like most people, in my opinion, the Summer
  2016 season of anime wasn’t all that great: no standout shows, and very few shows that compel you to watch every week.
  Hell, during the middle of the season, I had to stop following as much but usually when this happens, I’m still
  following a fair amount of shows week by week. This time, there was maybe one or two, much lower than what I’m used to
  seeing. That being said, unlike the sentiment online that believed Re:Zero was the only interesting show of the
  season, there was still a lot of great shows, some truly hidden gems. That’s what this list is going to have!</p>
<hr class="gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw"/><h3 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h102139"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>Rules
</h3>
<img alt src="./hoqr0ntzmr6yp0uajbcg.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">My rules of this list are simple: if it aired/released this season, it can go on
  this list. I don’t see the point in only giving a show one chance during it’s airing season, and this is my list so
  I’ll list my favorite shows regardless of what season it started on. If this means that one show hogs the top spot for
  2 seasons, than good for that show! If it’s an OVA or movie that came out during the duration of the season I fell in
  love with, then it may be there. Also, I think that the seasonal split is arbitrary and unnecessary, so it’s
  completely gone here. Sorry about that, but that’s how I’m doing it.<br/><br/><br/>Just an FYI, the placement of the show
  in the list is mostly based on my experience and enjoyment of the work, so if you’re wondering why something isn’t
  where you think it should be or you can’t really tell via the justification, that’s probably why. Keep in mind, just
  because a show is lower on the list doesn’t mean it’s bad - all of these are great, and a lower placement isn’t a mark
  against the show, at this point it’s nearly all personal preference.</p>

  their battle against the heroic spirit residing in the eighth class card. They’re back in vacation mode again, looking
  to make the most of what they have left of summer break. But their hopes get crushed in the blink of an eye. An

</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Justification &amp; Thoughts: </strong>Here’s a conundrum: you know
  something’s gonna be good because you have seen the previous adaptations, and you’ve experienced the source
  material... but you haven’t actually experienced the work itself. I really loved 3rei, but I didn’t watch all of 3rei,
  thus HMs for you. This is not because I didn’t like it, but because I was already caught up in the manga and
  retreading stories in different mediums can be annoying to see for everything, even if the equidistant versions are
  rather similar (though the anime amps up the fanservice.). If you’re a fan of fate, the twists that this does on F/SN
  are fascinating and makes for a trilling ride. </p>

</p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Justification &amp; Thoughts: </strong>Beautiful, emotional, memorable,
  endearing—these are just some of the words that one can use to describe <em>Planetarian</em> and its OVA adaptation
  made by David Production (of <em>JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure</em> fame), a work that will truly touch your heart. It’s
  short and sweet, being only five OVAs, but unlike most VNs,<em> Planetarian</em> is linear and short, making an
  adaptation possible in the fashion they did, and it was done rather effectively. <em>Planetarian</em> maximizes its
  limits, being a very focused and well-executed work that is almost movie-like in its storytelling, a great direction
  for a Key work. It enables them to do what people love about them, which works well with what it tries to do, which in
  my opinion is being a condensed version of everything great about Key (the makers of works like <em>Clannad</em>),
  without any of the negatives. The show provides the great parts of slice of life without the fluff, it’s engaging to
  watch throughout, and as one would expect from a Key work, it packs plenty of feelz. It’s a fantastic ride, and it’s
  definitely one to check out, especially now that is available in an animated form.</p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Justification &amp; Thoughts: </strong>Alderamin is an interesting one,
  being a work that falls into genres I’m not too big a fan on (fantasy) but it spins it in a way that makes it rather
  engaging to see (thanks to it’s focus on the military) and honestly, it’s way better than I expected. The premise may
  not be the most original, but thanks to madhouse’s magic touch, they made it compelling to watch, telling a military
  drama tale that shows bonds of characters and the horrors of war. It’s fantasy setting allows for an interesting blend
  of feudal and modern tactics, and the characters in this work are enjoyable to see while being engaging to learn
  about, making for a solid show throughout. It’s only 13 episodes and made by madhouse so we probably won’t see more,
  but what it has to offer is good time and worth a watch. </p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Justification &amp; Thoughts: </strong>Ahh... New Game. It’s everyone’s
  favorite show about cute game developer artists doing cute things! While there’s nothing surprising with this one,
  being Doga Kobo’s entry into the season, you’re getting a a fun and entertaining slice of life (loosely) based on the
  game industry and it definitely did it’s job making life all that much better. Every episodes is 30 minutes of fun as
  characters are entertaining to watch and the jokes are funny, never ceasing to put a smile on your face. If you’re

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Justification &amp; Thoughts: </strong>Food Wars is back! And It’s just as

  of fights, it still has a wonderufl and colorful cast of characers, and most importantly, it isone of the most fun
  shows to watch. It’s worth a watch, but just warning you that if you can’t really handle fanservice in anime, this is

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Justification &amp; Thoughts: </strong>Mob Psycho is notable for 2 reasons:
  It’s made by ONE, and it’s BONES. ONE, being the man behind One Punch Man, is also the creator of this work and it
  shows, with many attributes of that show being avaolible here. If you enjoyed the humor and style of that show, you’ll
  be right at home with Mob Psycho, and it made every moment fun to watch. It’s also a showcase of animation from BONES,
  who took ONE’s lackluster art and made it into something stylistic and spectacular, a feast for the eyes. Definitely
  watch the OP and EDs, they’re exapmles of artists pushing the limits of the medium, and it’s absolutely fascinating to
  see.</p>

  a bit rushed and the animation got durpy, this show is a blast and its a must watch for any anime fan who enjoys a
  good story.</p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Justification &amp; Thoughts: </strong>With ReLife, the question of “What’s
  my favorite show of the season” was over before it even began (consider it an Honorable 1st Place). Crunchyroll, for
  some odd reason, decided to release this show all at the beginning of the season, and I love them for it, enabling me
  to marathon a show that perfectly matches my preferences. I’m a sucker for romantic dramas, and to see one of them
  done so well in this fashion is something I really enjoyed. ReLife, more than anything, is about life, giving one a
  second chance while looking at what makes this tick, and this fuels a thrilling ride of character interactions that
  allow the viewer to get more and more attached to the cast as they watch. Along with that, ReLife has a great cast of
  characters with fascinating personalities, and plus, it’s funny, keeping the show always engaging to watch. Definitely
  a great time, and I can’t wait for more.</p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Justification &amp; Thoughts:</strong> When the internet started to sing
  it’s praises over the glory of<em> Kimi no Na wa</em>, I wasn’t the slightest bit surprised. That is, because during
  AX 2016, I was able to watch the world premiere of this movie and my mind was completely blown. While I always
  appreciated Shinkai’s works, I would be what most would describe as a Shinkai Skeptic because I would generally paint
  a negative picture on them when I talked about them. This is because I never really was engaged with them and the
  story they had to tell, but <em>Kimi no Na wa</em>... had my crying in my seat. Every moment was engaging, every
  moment was beautful, and most importantly, I was actually enjoying it, unlike so many of his works. This is one of the
  best anime movies ever made, and for it to not take the number one spot would be disrespectful to it.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">If you’re interested in reading more thoughts about <em>Kimi no Na wa</em>, <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","http://anitay.kinja.com/kimi-no-na-wa-your-name-the-anitay-review-1783309415",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://anitay.kinja.com/kimi-no-na-wa-your-name-the-anitay-review-1783309415" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">check out the AniTAY review</a></span>!</p>
