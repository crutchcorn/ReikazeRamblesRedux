Well<span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://ia601505.us.archive.org/8/items/podcast_20150408/podcast.mp3",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://ia601505.us.archive.org/8/items/podcast_20150408/podcast.mp3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">,</a></span>
  get ready, because it’s here!</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Welcome to the very first AniTAY Spoilercast! This is a
  new format for the AniTAY Podcast, where we spend a whole podcast talking about one specific show! I think it’s a nice
  medium between the laid back After Hours and the more serious main episodes, and with the community involvement from
  After Hours (we pull straight out of the chatroom), and the structure like the main episodes while differentiating
  itself by being totally about one show/work/etc. If everything goes according to plan, these spoilercasts should
  happen every month, with new people and new topics every time! Feedback would be very nice this time around as this is
  the first Spoilercast we’ve ever done :)</p>

  hinting at, this episode was an hour spent talking about <em>Your Lie in April</em>! From general thoughts to
  discussion about the core themes of the show, this episode is a full on chat about a show many on AniTAY hold near and
  dear to their hearts, and like the name implies, there will be spoilers, so be prepared! Also, I apologize in advance
  for editing issues, still pretty new to this…</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Podcast</strong></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">As always you can either download the file or subscribe to us on iTunes!</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Download MP3 <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://ia601505.us.archive.org/8/items/podcast_20150408/podcast.mp3",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://ia601505.us.archive.org/8/items/podcast_20150408/podcast.mp3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here </a></span>(Right
