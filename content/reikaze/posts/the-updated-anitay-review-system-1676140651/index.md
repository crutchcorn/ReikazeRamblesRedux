<div><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">The past few months, AniTAY’s been getting an identity. A growing sense of community, more
  and more reviews, and tons of articles... but the review system doesn’t really match the direction AniTAY is moving in
  my opinion so I decided to completely overhaul the system with the consent of pretty much everyone in the AniTAY
  community, so here they are.</p>

</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Once again, This system is basically a guideline that can be used in your own
  review system. You have full rights to alter the assets in any way you want. The only thing you cannot do is call it
  an “___: The AniTAY Review” unless you use it exactly as described here. Anything up until that point is fair
  game.</strong></p>

<hr class="gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw"/><h2 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h107121"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>The
  Updated AniTAY Review System:</h2><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Nothing’s really changed when it comes to the actual
  system itself, so structurally it’s like all the other AniTAY reviews you’ve seen before and very similar to <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","Internal link","http://tay.kotaku.com/an-all-new-tay-review-system-that-you-can-use-if-you-w-1523594576",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://tay.kotaku.com/an-all-new-tay-review-system-that-you-can-use-if-you-w-1523594576">TAY’s</a></span>. You
  put the AniTAY sticker on your header image (resizing it so that it doesn’t seem too overpowering if need be) and
  you’re already using the system. The new assets are to give AniTAY a more cohesive look and a more unique identity,
  but you don’t need to follow them exactly. (hell, the <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","http://anitay.kinja.com/rockmandash-reviews-durarara-anime-1665959528",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://anitay.kinja.com/rockmandash-reviews-durarara-anime-1665959528" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first review</a></span> based
  on the new assets doesn’t even follow the system)</p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>The format is like this:</strong><br/></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">
<strong>1. </strong>The title will be “<em>Name of the Anime</em>: The <em>AniTAY</em> Review” You italicize the name
  with Ctrl+I with the new editor, just highlight the text you want italicized, then click it.</p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>2.</strong> An indicative image of the anime you are reviewing that conveys
  the show in a manner you see fit (see header image for this article). Remember, try to make the width 800 Pixels so it
  doesn’t have any issues.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>3.</strong> An introduction section where you
  explain the setting and basic starting plot of the anime.</p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>4.</strong> The three major header sections. You may drop specific sections
  at your own discretion. If you want to change the text, the font is Century Gothic, and it should come on your
  computer, or if not, download it from the assets. </p>

<img alt src="./1461042037399423887.png"/>
<img alt src="./1461042037464677263.png"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Each section will have the main points that apply to them, just like the TAY
  reviews, and the reviews we’ve had in the past. I’ll use an example from Koda’s <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","http://anitay.kinja.com/when-supernatural-battles-became-commonplace-the-ani-t-1675955982",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://anitay.kinja.com/when-supernatural-battles-became-commonplace-the-ani-t-1675955982" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Inou-Battle review</a></span>. </p>
<blockquote class="sc-8hxd3p-0 nvIqO" data-type="BlockQuote"><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Trigger’s Animation
  is Still in Top Form</strong></p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">While Inou-Battle may not have enough battles in it to allow Trigger to go over the top
    awesome like they did in Kill la Kill, they still at least get to use their dynamic, comedic animation style to
    great effect. Inou-Battle is still quite a GIF-machine of a series with numerous standout moments of animation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>5. </strong>The end of the review will be denoted by the “Conclusion banner”
  closely followed by the Review Card, which has been completely overhauled. The review card is populated by a whole
  mess of aggregated information and one of three “ratings”: “Go for It!”, “Proceed with Caution”, and “Not Worth Your
  Time”. This is, again, adapted from the TAY Review system. For the Information, you can put whatever you want, but try
  to include who made it. I personally like to have the airing time, and length, with where I watched it in the What
  AniTAY watched segment.</p>

  Words:</h2><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">You are free to use any elements you want from this package and tweak it as
  much as you can. I’m probably the worst with this, customizing the assets so much you can barely recognize it XD. That
  being said, if you are going to use the AniTAY moniker, try to use the rules in this review. If we had “The AniTAY
  Review” articles that completely jettisoned this system, it would be a bit confusing.</p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">This asset update was made to give AniTAY a bit more identity, and to make it look
  better and more consistent than before. If you don’t like it, or prefer to use some other assets, I’m not stopping
  you, and there’s nothing wrong with that. I made these for the community (and because I thought TAY assets looked
  kinda off on AniTAY when the rest of the stuff has changed), so I hope you appreciate them and enjoy using them as
  much as I do.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><em>*Note: This post was updated on 3/20/15 to include the Review Card
