  still manages to amaze? That's a perfect description of <em>Ao Haru Ride</em>, a Shoujo that was adapted by Production
  I.G.</p>

<img alt src="./egrk1aaitnt69iumijof.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> What makes <em>Ao Haru Ride</em> great is the solid execution overall. Even though
  I haven't read the manga at the time of writing to compare it to, I can see all of the effort that Production I.G. put
  into adapting a story of bonds, relationships, and devastation which is done very well. The story follows Futaba
  Yoshioka, a girl who had a crush on Kou Tanaka, but he decided to move away at the end of middle school before she had
  the opportunity to tell him her feelings. Futaba decides that she would have an unlady-like personality in high school
  due to his move, but as she is living with this personality, she suddenly meets Kou. Like Futaba however, Kou's
  changed quite a bit. He's much more distant, and he has a new last name: Mabuchi. They go through normal school life,
  but the interactions between them start to shape who they are, and how they view the world.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> From a storytelling aspect, the execution of the story strikes all the right boxes. It has
  great pacing, an amazing feeling of progression in each episode, solid character development, and great character
  interactions. What I did not expect out of this shoujo was the great themes this show covered and how well it did
  them: friendship, social structure, growing pains in relationships, building up shattered relationships, events that
  change a person forever, etc. This show is deeper than you would expect, taking things that everyone accepts out of
  relationships like this, pointing it out in a way that was enjoyable, and making changes in said relationship that
  feels real. The scenes in this show are done very well, and when the "feels" hits, it hits hard. They are themes that
  aren't expected from a shoujo nowadays, but they really enhance what's there and they fit well in the story.</p>

<img alt src="./916611654163593029.jpg"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> There was one theme in particular that they had early on that I really enjoyed: the theme
  of chasing the past. The events already happened, and it was done and over with, but the desire for it to be the way
  it used to be is one that hit home for me, and it was done so well that I can't help but admire it. It got me attached
  to the characters, and was just a blast to experience.</p>
<h4 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h112928"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>Side Characters that Actually
  Matter</h4>
<img alt src="./p0eeh2c1pyxaseimrehm.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> While Ao Haru Ride is very much so a traditional shoujo focused on romance, I
  really appreciated the development of the side characters: something that most shoujo have, but rarely develop. Seeing
  the focus on friendship and social status being equivalent to the focus of the main relationship makes this show feel
  that much more believable, and it's a nice fresh breath of air. Seeing side characters with depth, and developing
  relationships was something that I wish every show has.</p><h4 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h112929"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>I.G. does it again, even in a Shoujo</h4>
<img alt src="./916611654188971589.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> If there's one thing I can count on I.G., it's a consistent standard of quality,
  especially when it comes to visuals. The art is beautiful, with an awesome water colored look at times that I really
  enjoyed. It adds a lot of charm to the show, and I appreciate it. The characters look nice and the scenery... it's
  great. It builds a great atmosphere to compliment the scene, the backgrounds look pleasing to the eyes, and they have
  good lines and great framing, which is something many shows don't really care about nowadays. It's a nice looking
  show, as expected from I.G.</p><h4 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h112930"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>Oh,

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> If you know anything about me and my reviews, you would know that I always gripe on
  the usage of a soundtrack in a show to no end. The sound can add a layer of emotion that's unavailable in forms of
  media without sound, which I usually describe as "making the mood". Why am I saying this general description of my
  reviewing of sound? It's because <em>Ao Haru Ride</em> uses sound in a way that I wish every show did, and I was
  seriously impressed by how powerful and impactful the soundtrack was on my experience with the show. The great scenes
  are solid on its own, but what really pushes them over the edge of greatness is the soundtrack. The soundtrack is well
  composed, helps the atmosphere and has some amazing piano playing that I loved. They left an impact on me, and I was
  humming the tunes hours after I finished the episode. They were memorable, well utilized, and very well done; pretty
  much everything I ask out of a soundtrack.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> There's no way I'd be able to wrap up a
  soundtrack talk without a mention of the OP. This season has been rolling with great OP's, and this is no exception.
  It captures the essence of the show extremely well, and it's very pleasing to the ear. On a side note, I had no issues
  with the voice actors, but I'm not really a "Pro Voice Actor Rater".</p>

<img alt src="./gmcuqyf7lene0hriyrt9.png"/><h4 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h112931"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>It's a very Shoujo Show</h4>
<img alt src="./916611658627610949.png"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> If you are a fan of Shoujo, you got it here. This is a very by the books, simple
  yet a bit generic Shoujo romance, with all the pros and cons that come with that type of story. For someone who loves
  this kind of story, they'll love it, but because of how "traditional" it is, this might be a huge deterrent. If you
  aren't a fan of the genre, or you are looking for something new or different, you guys aren't getting it here. This
  show doesn't do anything really new in the genre, it's the same tried and true formula, but done very well. <em>Ao
    Haru Ride </em>doesn't try to differentiate itself from the of the genre, it does what it wants to do, even if
  that's been done tons of times. It hits all the notes, but it doesn't cover new ground.</p><h4 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h112932"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>The Characters</h4>
<img alt src="./916611658677051205.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> Overall, I like most of the characters. Kou Mabuchi is cynical, caring, enjoyable,
  and has an interesting backstory that makes him more interesting as you go on. Due to some event that I'm not going to
  talk about due to spoilers, he's closed himself up, afraid of putting any effort or emotion into anything, and this
  was very enjoyable to watch in my opinion. Like I said before, the side characters quite a bit development in
  comparison to most shoujo and because of that, they were interesting, dynamic, and enjoyable. The contrast between
  Yuri and Futaba's friends at the beginning of the story is great, and the interactions between the cast was great.
  They built bonds, and grew a beautiful friendship that was fun to watch. The cast in Ao Haru Ride is pretty good.</p>
<img alt src="./ufvmtm1xw1xtvx3ec0yb.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> However, Futaba at times really got on my nerves. While Futaba is a solid main
  character for most of the show, sometimes she's just annoying and grating to me. This may be just be me being a guy
  and not liking the actions of a girl in love acting impulsively, but her habit of jumping to the wrong conclusions
  always will rub me the wrong way, and at times it'll just piss me off. It's these impulsive actions that get the cast
  into into stupid scenarios, one that Kou and others have to fix...hell, the reason she changed her personality and
  caused half of the whole show's strained relationship is due to her impulsiveness. This impulsiveness helps the show
  in the end, but in my opinion, it was a negative portion of the story for most of it.</p><h4 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h112933"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>Enjoyment</h4>
<img alt src="./916617657535572372.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> I really loved the show at the beginning. The themes, characters, everything, it
  drew me into the story, and I was saying it was the best show of the season. When the show settled down however, it
  was just running through your typical slice of life, day to day shoujo stuff, with these interesting themes. While I
  wish <em>Ao Haru Ride</em> stayed strong and engaging like the early episodes, I enjoyed everything it did, but your
  enjoyment pretty much hinges on one simple fact: it's a shoujo and it doesn't do much to differentiate. I enjoyed it
  because I like shoujo, but if you don't like shoujo, you won't like it.</p><h4 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h112934"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>The Anime Ending</h4><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> Due to the fact that the anime
  is one cour, and this is an ongoing manga, they have to find a place to stop. The place they stopped is a pretty nice
  stopping point, finishing up a major arc, yet making you anticipate more but not in a frustrated way. It's not a bad
  place to end, and it's probably the best place it could have had to end, but the ending wasn't amazing.</p>

<img alt src="./bu697hdorb9uyficpcpw.png"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><em>Ao Haru Ride</em> is a well done Shoujo for Shoujo fans. I had a great time
  with it, and I think you probably will too. If you like Shoujo, then you'll probably like it as much as I do, but if
  not, <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","http://anitay.kinja.com/gekkan-shoujo-nozaki-kun-rockmandashs-ani-tay-review-1634657276",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://anitay.kinja.com/gekkan-shoujo-nozaki-kun-rockmandashs-ani-tay-review-1634657276" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">you may want to try something else</a></span>. If you need me,
  I'll be reading the manga.</p>
