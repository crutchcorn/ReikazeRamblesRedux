  that i’m a big fan of Falcom and in particular, their Trails series. Recently, <em>Trails From Zero</em> and<em>
    Trails to Azure</em>, which are currently stuck in localization purgatory, were made playable in English thanks to
  the efforts of fans. These are incredible games that I recommend and are legitimately some of my favorites... but
  rather than just talk my straight thoughts on the game, I feel compelled to spend some time talking about the
  brilliance that is the setting of Crossbell, and the beautiful political storytelling that is the Crossbell Arcs - how
  it inverts the traditional storytelling paradigm and has city drive the story, instead of the story driving the world
  building.</p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Disclaimer-</strong> this video doesn’t spoil any specific story elements of
  the Trails games, but talks in great length about the geopolitics of the setting and it’s correlations with real life
  locations. I try to avoid mentioning specific events, but the stuff I say might be spoiling events indirectly so if
  you want to go into <em>Zero </em>and <em>Azure</em> blind, I’d recommend leaving now. </p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Also, I’d just like to shout out <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://geofront.esterior.net/",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://geofront.esterior.net/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Geofront</a></span> - the work put
  into quality of life improvements are just as impressive as the work put into the translation itself.... and the
  chests. A little touch that adds so much character to the games, legitimately was dismayed when I got to
  <em>Azure </em>and those weren’t there. They do incredible work and playing their release of <em>Zero</em> was great.
  Right now, <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://geofront.esterior.net/2020/03/15/trails-from-zero-out-now/",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://geofront.esterior.net/2020/03/15/trails-from-zero-out-now/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Geofront only has released a patch for<em> Zero</em></a></span>, but
  they are planning on releasing a patch for Azure - I played an older TL but i’d recommend waiting if you can.<br/><br/>One
  more also: I made a video verison of this article! Feel free to check it out: </p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">My experience with the first game I’ve played in the series, <em>Trails in the
  Sky</em> was a bit of being at the <em>right place,at the right time</em>:<em> </em><span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://tay.kinja.com/my-love-for-falcom-games-or-how-falcom-shaped-my-exper-1752613309",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://tay.kinja.com/my-love-for-falcom-games-or-how-falcom-shaped-my-exper-1752613309" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Sky</em> revived my love for a genre I came to hate at the time.</a></span> Thanks to a
  one two punch of amazing characters and amazing storytelling, sky quickly became one of my favorite games ever, to the
  point in which I’d say it’s my favorite RPG of all time, and second favorite game period, right behind <em>The Legend
    of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.</em><br/></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Personally, what makes Falcom works truly
  special, truly unique from anything else I’ve played is the attention to world-building they’ve managed throughout the
  series, leading to an amazing and incredible world that one can’t help but feel attached to. We see all these AAA devs
  try to use giant open worlds and throw money to try to create an immersive world that feels real - yet few have
  created works that seem to come close.</p>

<img alt src="./ij2ad2lrrgbzy8iksnro.jpg"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Falcom, the small Japanese dev has managed to accomplish this, not with technical
tricks or graphical fidelity, but with attention to detail and excellent writing. NPCs aren’t just NPCs - they are
written as people who have their own lives. Everyone has their own story, “NPC”s are just people who you don’t have
direct involvement in the story. The places you visit feel incredibly alive because the individuals feel alive. The
places aren’t huge, but incredibly detailed - these aren’t giant empty husks but compact and fleshed locations that
feel like places where real people live. These places are also inherently weaved into the main story itself, with
important people being inherently linked to the place.<br/></p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">The more time I spend away from Trails, the more I couldn’t help but be wowed about
  how incredible the world they’ve built was and how others simply just aren’t there. Locations aren’t just places you
  visit, but places people live, real cities that are alive, real nations that have real political differences and
  viewpoints. The geopolitics of Zemuria is convincing and compelling, in depth to a level that could be confused with
  real life locations.</p>
<img alt src="dhulpotkuzvqwvdpfeva.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">The driving force of the newer games of the story, from my viewpoint then, is
  primarily to grow and develop the world. Sure, there’s an overarching story that connects the story, but the world is
  an inherent part of that plot progression. Sky focused on the small kingdom of Liberl, a nation with a power void and
  reeling from an invasion, and the<em> Cold Steel arc</em> is focused on the giant empire of Erobonia, the nation that
  invaded in <em>Sky</em>, with rising tensions between the glowingly authoritarian national government and the regional
  powers that are ran by the nobles of the nation and represent tradition. But, there was something that has to be said
  - the more you play through the <em>Cold Steel</em> arc, the more you can’t help but feel like something’s truly
  missing, a feeling that’s totally justified... because something was missing.</p>
<img alt src="uo9kyk73vzfume6fc36x.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">The first two games in the <em>Trails of Cold Steel </em>series take place at the
  same time as another series. While you’re focused on the civil war in Erebonia, other just as significant events occur
  in the city of Crossbell that you witness from a big picture perspective, but don’t really get to see what happens,
  which goes against the nature of Trails’ world building. This is of course, because those events are thoroughly
  explored in the Crossbell arc,<em> Trails from Zero</em> and <em>Trails To Azure</em>, the games sent in the said
  city.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Even before I played the Crossbell games, Crossbell was a location I was
  eagerly awaiting to visit. It almost seemed like a time Anachronism; a place that couldn’t possibly exist given the
  developing nature of the world. To give some background - The trails games take place on a continent called Zemuria,
  specifically in the west half of the continent. When these games take place, From Septian Calendar S1202 through
  S1206, and the world is rapidly industrializing thanks to Orbal revolution. Orbals, just technology wise, are
  effectively a clean power source for anything and can effectively do anything, drive vehicles, power electronics, and
  more.<br/></p>

<img alt src="./tabnwh2ta0nhfltq8jsw.jpg"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Compared to our world, It’s like the 2nd and 3rd industrial revolutions all
crammed into an incredibly short time period, and it leads to incredible variants in technology throughout the world,
even more so than ours - the location of Sky, Liberl, is a nation that has great air infrastructure with an airport in
every town but is a nation that hasn’t fully industrialized, and Erebonia is a nation with a vast rail network
connecting the giant empire together, but both feel Pre-World War 2 in technology in regards to infrastructure, for
the most part.</p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Enter the city of Crossbell, a modern metropolis comparable to what we have in our
  world. Crossbell, in the world of Zemuria is incredibly special - while most of the world has bits and pieces of
  technology, Crossbell has everything - an airport, rail infrastructure, orbal cars and busses zipping around,
  glistening skyscrapers like the Orchis Tower, Amusement parks, and the internet! Crossbell is a major economic hub
  where everything comes together, a city straddled between two major powers - the Empire of Erobonia, and the equally
  large Republic of Cavard... which leads us into the political situation of Crossbell and the genius of the games.
  There’s so much depth with the setting that the geopolitics of the game itself drives the story!</p>
<img alt src="qqiaxo38zyivqwgcdpnw.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Crossbell, is a self-governing buffer state that, after being fought over and traded
  hands several times, was made to be a tributary state where both nations serve as a suzerain over Crossbell. This is
  simultaneously a bane and a boon for Crossbell - Crossbell’s economic prowess is a result of its status of being a hub
  between them but their political nature leaves Crossbell beholden to both nations and incapable of making its own
  decisions. Its legislature is effectively designed to be ineffective, it’s police can’t really enforce the law on
  citizens from either the empire or from the republic.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">The State of Crossbell itself
  is effectively a character and is really the focus of the game. Trapped by major powers with its fate basically
  dictated by them, but became rich and powerful because of that it’s hard not to think of places like Hong Kong and
  Kashmir, and the dread because the nature of the state itself is hanging on a thread. <em>Zero </em>and<em> Azure</em>
  immerses you into the game and allows you to feel everything about the city- it’s people, places, but most definitely
  the situation.</p>

<img alt src="./voh0y2fsci0wxfdk1qjw.jpg"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">While technically politically closest to<span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T49ERQDuBGc",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T49ERQDuBGc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Andora</a></span>, Hong
Kong is definitely the closest emotionally and situationally because of its situation as an economic gateway and hub,
the balance between Hong Kong’s British past and Chinese influence is a rather similar situation, and the uncertainty
and impending doom, the lack of having your own real voice in what happens in the land you love and live in, it’s all
eerily similar to the situation of Hong Kong and now with the protests. How important is the self-rule of Crossbell if
it’s effectively overruled by the two suzerain states?<br/><br/>Kashmir comes to mind because of its landlocked
existence between two warring powers and disputed nature. Hong Kong doesn’t have to deal with the impending doom of
being invaded by a nation if each other asserts more sovereignty over the nation, Kashmir does. The hostility between
nations is much more like a Kashmir situation than a Hong Kong situation.</p>

<img alt src="./ljrvtq7o4jwb5fvhwq1k.jpg"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Yet at the same time, Crossbell is unique - it has way more influence than both
Hong Kong or Kashmir - it has a premise and impact that is much more significant than each of those states - while it
doesn’t have much political power, it’s one of the most important economic hubs of the continent and as a result can
stand with the others in conferences like the West Zemuria Trade Conference which it hosts.</p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">There’s something really compelling about a city like this, with the different
  feuding factions, with the technological advancement, it all adds up to be an incredibly intriguing location with
  depth, and heart. And the best part about all of this is that the way that Crossbell is implemented into the story
  of<em> Zero</em> and <em>Azure</em> means that you as a player gets to feel all of this political tension as the SSS
  has an incredible intimacy with the city - the people, the locations, and the political structure as all of this
  affects you in one way or another. Hell, even the themes of the game, seeking the truth and getting over barriers
  either feed into the setting or are founded because of the setting itself.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">A dark
  future seemingly looms above the city, what can be done about it? How does that affect the citizens and what are the
  dynamics that such scenarios cause? There’s so many strong emotions that lead as a result of the setting and it’s one
  of my favorite settings in fiction.</p>

<img alt src="./gr16g9ia2pzg1nip39kl.jpg"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">In the Crossbell arc, events are driven by the nature of the Crossbell state, and
the political events of Crossbell are the important story elements of<em> Zero </em>and <em>Azure</em>. The Crossbell
arc isn’t a story driven by victory like so many other games. The games effectively immerse you in this political
reality and throughout your hours in this city you get to feel, stew and think about the political situations of this
city. All the events and characters feed into the story of the city. I can only think of a few times that a work has
effectively made the setting a character - <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://rockmandash12.kinja.com/rockmandash-reviews-428-shibuya-scramble-1830053550",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://rockmandash12.kinja.com/rockmandash-reviews-428-shibuya-scramble-1830053550" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>428: Shibuya Scramble</em></a></span>,
<em>Legend of the Galactic Heroes </em>comes to mind, and I’ve loved it every time.</p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">There’s no real “good or bad” guy, there’s political differences. Crossbell and the
  SSS are placed in a tricky situation where there’s no objective good, there’s powers in place that mean you can’t just
  win, and this grounded nature truly makes these games special. This fact has made Crossbell’s storytelling some of the
  most compelling, engaging, relatable content out there. This is one of the few works I’ve experience that *gets*
  geopolitics, and I’m really glad I’ve had the opportunity to play it.</p>
<hr class="gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw"/>
<img alt src="ltwetsiivq2seyy2lzkv.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">The Crossbell arc then, is special because it pulls off something I can’t help but
  be impressed by. From it’s world building alone, Falcom has managed to tell a compelling geopolitical story that’s
  legitimately some of the best I’ve personally seen. By drawing parallels to real life political situations, it creates
  an atmosphere of dread that’s inherent to locations that are in scenarios like Crossbell and makes for an incredibly
  convincing and moving story. It’s a masterclass in political storytelling, and I’m incredibly glad I had the
  opportunity to play this game.<br/></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">PS. I do have to mention that there are plenty of
  merits to the games outside of the setting, with the primary one being that the cast of Crossbell is so lovable
  (<strong>TIO IS BEST GIRL</strong>) but, you can see <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://twitter.com/Reikaze0/status/1245225010517569536",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://twitter.com/Reikaze0/status/1245225010517569536" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">my two</a></span> <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://twitter.com/Reikaze0/status/1256501786090696704",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://twitter.com/Reikaze0/status/1256501786090696704" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">twitter threads</a></span>
