<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Plot summaries and first impressions can be quite inaccurate at times, completely
  misrepresenting the work that it’s supposed to represent, and <em>Punch Line</em> is probably the most extreme example
  of this that I have seen. From the source itself:</p>
<blockquote class="sc-8hxd3p-0 nvIqO" data-type="BlockQuote"><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><em>If he sees underwear,
  humanity will be destroyed!? An original anime series from the noitaminA block, PUNCH LINE centers on Yuta Iridatsu, a
  high school student, with a peculiar habit. When he sees a girl’s panties, he gets so excited he faints! After a
  certain incident with a ghost cat, his soul gets separated from his body. Using his special powers, Yuta watches the
  daily lives of the inhabitants of an apartment and sometimes plays tricks on them. Eventually, Yuta decides to unlock
  the secrets to why Earth will be destroyed and tries to save it!</em></p></blockquote>

<img alt src="./1313950704267840357.png"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Given that, you would assume the show is about looking at panties, but it’s not.

    Punch Line</em> starts out as this ecchi show but turns into a SciFi show about the world ending due to the Qmay
  group hurling an astroid into the earth with the members of the Korai house trying to stop them. Full of twists,
  character development and interesting elements like time travel and body switching, this show has a meaningful story
  and one that is well written, well executed and a joy to watch.</p>

</aside><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">It’s executed like a lighter version of Uchikoshi’s works: it’s not super hard
  SciFi like in the Zero Escape and Infinity series (Probably due to time restraints, this is a 12 episode anime after
  all), with the SciFi being pretty much irrelevant and focusing on the characters and scenerio at hand (with the world
  ending and all) but like everything he’s done, it’s done really well, and his writing style really shines through. It
  creates a great sense of mystery and like his other works, it slowly unravels that mystery in a very satisfying way.
  Every scene, regardless of if it’s important or not is done pretty well, and it really ramps up the tension and action
  later on. It’s pretty great. </p>

  the visuals are a big part of that.</p>

  most of the music in <em>Punch Line</em> isn’t exactly that, with the music serving a supporting role. That being
  said, don’t let that make it sound like it’s a bad thing though, as this soundtrack does a great job at supporting the
  show, putting the viewer in the mood that the scenes dictate and they really help engage the viewer with the work.
  Whether it’s an upbeat scene or one that’s more somber, the music does a great job at fitting in, working well and
  just doing a good job at being a soundtrack.<br/></p>

<img alt src="./1313950704535812453.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><em>Punch Line</em> is a fun show: if you can get past a few things I’ll talk about
  later, it does pretty much everything it can to put a smile on your face, or keep you engaged with what it’s trying to
  do. From absolutely hilarious comedy (I particularly liked chiranosuke’s videos he was watching or the Strange Juice
  transformation scene in Ep1) to a really well rounded, developed and interesting cast, this show is a great experience
  to watch, one that will keep you entertained as you watch through it.<br/><br/>Also, the small touches are nice too, and
  really help the story along: All the character’s names have puns in them, the references to Uchikoshi works are
  entertaining to those who know them (no pepsiman tho), and watching it a second time around is a really nice
  experience.</p>

<h4 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h105559"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>Iffy Pacing</h4>
<img alt src="./1313950704725512037.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Writing for a visual novel doesn’t always translate well to an anime, and <em>Punch
  Line</em>, along with <em>Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works</em> really shows how Visual Novel adaptations (or at
  least VN writers writing an anime) struggle with serialization: VNs are meant to be marathoned, and Anime has to be
  broken up into pieces. Due to this fundamental difference in pacing the work, the pacing of this show was averages at
  best and frustrating at worst, and as good as Uchikoshi’s writing is, it doesn’t really help here. He likes to use the
  middle of his works with random events that build up clues later on, like a good majority of the scenes in <em>Ever
    17</em>, but in anime form, this just led to filler episodes that were frankly, boring. This was a pretty annoying
  issue with the first half of the show, as they tried to change the show from the silly show that was episode one into
  the more character focused show it eventually became.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">These pacing issues can take
  out most of the momentum that this has to viewers, and the fact that this is a serialized work makes it worse for
  those currently watching. <em>Punch Line </em>is a show where you actually need to know what was happening before hand
  due to how they progress with the plot, and a week off can throw you completely off on this. For the most part, the
  pacing of the story is livable, but it could have been better handled.</p>

  Line</em>’s Perversion</h4>
<img alt src="./1313950704911490405.png"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Even if the storyline isn’t just ecchi BS, <em>Punch Line </em>has a lot of
  fanservice, if you haven’t noticed yet. I really don’t know what to say here, to defend this or smash this, because
  it’s titillation for titillation’s sake, but they handle it in a way that makes it engaging and totally relevant to
  the story. While Punch Line gives out the vibe that this is the main premise of the show, and makes it comical to the
  point that it’s laughing at my feeble attempts to argue about it (like <em>Kill la Kill</em>), but it really only
  plays a role for 3 episodes, then surviving as an unnecessary plot point from there with relatively annoying panty
  shots all over the place.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">The fact that the show even uses this gimmick is kinda
  annoying, considering that they don’t really do anything with it, treating it as a side thing that feels shoehorned in
  even though it’s supposed to be the main plot. Literally, if they changed one plot point, there would be no point in
  this at all... it’s frustrating. I totally get what they were going with here, trying to get you connected to the MC,
  as Yuta acted pretty prude whenever he saw them but I really felt like this show could have done without it and it may
  have been more enjoyable. </p>

  you would know that I fell in love with this show: I loved everything it was doing from doing subtle references back
  to Uchikoshi’s other works to the overall high octane energy that this show had, smashing my expectations that this
  would be nothing but a stupid ecchi show. Unfortunately, Punchline did not keep the absolutely absurd shenanigans that
  I loved from first episode, and it dropped down to a slump of slow character development into the typical Uchikoshi
  fare, but not as awesome. What they built up was an action-y, almost <em>FLCL</em> like show that’s so absurd that you
  can’t help but love it, but they went absolutely nowhere with it. </p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">I was pretty
  exited to see another <em>FLCL</em>-like absurd show that does not give a single care about what people thought about
  it, but that’s not exactly what happened here. I was hoping that we’d get something totally different from Uchikoshi
  and he’d be able to walk the line between his typical works an the absurd show they showed in episode one, but that’s
  not what happened. The show we got was pretty good overall, being fun to watch for the most part, doing everything
  pretty well in general, but I wish the show tried to keep the absurd, action packed tone that the first episode has.

<img alt src="./1313950705382471269.png"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><em>Punch Line</em> is an odd show, acting like an ecchi show turned <em>Zero Escape:
  Lite</em>, taking everything Uchkoshi typically does well and watering it down to fit the type of show it is, but not
  at the same time. Of course, because it’s an Uchikoshi work the writing is as great as usual, it’s fun to go through
  and the plot is engaging, but there’s some core issues that may keep you from enjoying this show. Personally? I liked
  it for the most part, but was kinda disappointed in some aspects. Your mileage may vary.</p>
