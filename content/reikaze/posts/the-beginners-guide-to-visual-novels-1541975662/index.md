<div><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">What exactly is a Visual Novel? Why should I care, and why are you talking about them? The
  Visual Novel Genre is a confusing genre, especially if you have no idea what it’s about. I’m here to try to help:
  Today on Rockmandash Reviews is my Beginner’s Guide to one of my favorite genres in gaming, Visual Novels.</p>

  started, there is one thing I need to clarify; I’m talking about Visual Novels as a genre, not about dating sims.
  <strong>NOT ALL VISUAL NOVELS ARE DATING SIMS. </strong>Dating sims are a Sub-Genre of Visual Novels, if that. A lot
  of them aren’t even VN’s. Get it? Ok, good. Let’s move on.</p>

  is a Visual Novel?</em></h2>
<div class="ooo3c9-0 PpIMM align--bleed has-video media-large video-embed embed-frame"><span class="flex-video widescreen"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Shqd1lhah4" width="560"></iframe><span class="js_recommend" data-chomp-id="8Shqd1lhah4" data-recommend-id="youtube://8Shqd1lhah4" data-recommended="false" id="youtube-8Shqd1lhah4"></span></span></div><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">A Visual Novel is
  genre of video games (I like to think of it as an interactive storytelling medium, as there isn’t really much
  gameplay), that’s similar to Choose Your Own Adventure books and Adventure games from the 90’s. As the name implies,
  Visual Novels are text heavy, but they usually have music, voice acting and stills of characters to help you get
  absorbed into the story. The biggest gameplay aspect of a Visual novel is choices; The player has to decide what the
  protagonist does in the form of options. The options can lead you to different story plotlines called routes, or they
  could just lead you to a bad end and you’ll have to try again. Visual Novels without choices are usually referred to
  as Sound Novels or Kinetic Novels.</p>

<hr class="gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw"/><h2 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h122064"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a><em>Why
  should I care?</em></h2>
<img alt src="./1381548999286848841.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Visual novels are a very flexible genre, storytelling wise. Visual novels have very
  little restrictions, story wise, as they can go on and have a ton of exposition without making a book
  <strong>HUGE</strong>, they have the flexibility of multiple routes, they don’t have to comply with arbitrary rules
  set by TV companies and using the genre to mess with you. The <em>Fate/ stay night</em> Visual novel is a good example
  of this, as it’s 50+ hours, had 3 separate routes, and having Shirou as a narrator can skew your viewpoint. The
  flexibility leads to many visual novels to have amazing stories. Because of the excellent stories from this genre,
  many popular visual novels get anime adaptations. Some of the most well known adaptations are <em>Clannad, Fate/stay
    night, Steins;Gate, and Higurashi</em>. Some of you may be asking, why would I play Visual Novels if I could watch
  the anime? There are many parts of the visual novels that do not get adapted, and sometimes the adaptation is kinda
  bad. Also, there are some great visual novels that have not been adapted, like <em>Phoenix Wright, G-Senjou no Maou,
    999: Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors, and</em><span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","http://z2.ifrm.com/10702/60/0/p1008035/hisuisays_enhanced.gif",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://z2.ifrm.com/10702/60/0/p1008035/hisuisays_enhanced.gif" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em> Tsukihime</em></a></span>that

  is it like to play a Visual Novel?</em></h2>
<img alt src="./1381548999374013257.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">How exactly do Visual Novels play? It’s like watching a really long anime, or
  reading a book that’s kinda animated. It’s easiest to describe as a mix between a book and an anime. On average, they
  are usually much longer than the anime counterparts, which give them time to flesh out the characters and the world.
  Usually, Visual Novels have branching routes, where stories have some similarities (known as a common route), but
  overall could be considered their own stories (ex: Heaven’s feel in <em>Fate/stay nigh</em>t). In any Visual Novel,
  usually you have to go on a path and stick with it. When you stray away from the route you are in, you’ll probably run
  into what’s known as a BAD END, where something horrible or pointless happens. Also, i’ll insert the <strong>OBLIGITORY
    EROGE WARNING</strong> here; Many Visual Novels are Eroges, meaning they have NSFW content. Many have censorship
  patches, or none of this content at all, but if type of content is not up your alley, be prepared.</p>
<hr class="gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw"/><h2 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h122066"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a><em>How
  would I get my hands on a Visual Novel?</em></h2>
<img alt src="./othk9zfrurfqmyknjr7e.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">The fact that Visual Novels are not popular in the west means that most of them are
  kinda hard to get over here. <strike>Many companies do not translate and make English versions, so you are pretty much
    have to rely on fan translations</strike>. In the past, most VNs never got English versions, but as of late, there’s
  been a trend to localize VNs, so if you know that the game has an official US release, I’d go and support the
  publisher on their site, or places like rightstuf. Also, if the Visual Novel doesn’t have sexual content or has a
  Non-H version, there’s a good chance you can get the game over at Steam. If not, you’ll have to torrent them, and the
  best selection of VNs I’ve found is Mofumoe, after Fuwanovel stopped hosting torrents. It’s important to note that
  many Visual Novels do not find their way outside of Japan, which can be depressing if you found game or series really
  like.</p>
<hr class="gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw"/><h2 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h122067"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a><em>Terms
  used in Visual Novel talk:</em></h2>
<img alt src="./1381548999599590473.png"/>

<ul class="sc-1lmbno3-0 dpuHif" data-style="Bullet" data-type="List">
<li><strong>Visual Novel</strong> - This is an umbrella term used in the west to designate a type of game which is
    particularly story-focused, or containing novel-like narration in its writing. In Japan, such games are generally
    referred to as “love adventure games” (恋愛ADV/AVG), or novel game (ノベルゲーム noberu gēmu, in short: NVL).
  </li>
<li><strong>Routes </strong>- The name that refers to a story line in visual novels. Non-linear branching story lines
    are a common trend in visual novels, and these branching story lines are routes.
  </li>
<li><strong>Kinetic Novel </strong>- Kinetic novels are visual novels without choices, so all you do is read.</li>
</ul>

<img alt src="./dcwht27dcemdl2ijb5os.jpg"/>
<ul class="sc-1lmbno3-0 dpuHif" data-style="Bullet" data-type="List">
<li><strong>Sound Novel </strong>- Sound novels is a trademark from Chunsoft. The term is the original word referring
    to novel type games.However “Visual Novels” became prevalent due to other companies using it in order to avoid the
    company’s trademark.This term later was known because of Higurashi, which used it because the sound was more
    important than the actual visuals, so they called it sound novels. 07th Expansion’s sound novels are essentially
    kinetic novels with a focus on sound to create an atmosphere.
  </li>
<li><strong>Dating Sim</strong> - Technically, this term refers to simulation games focused on dating. However, this
    term is frequently used by English speakers to describe any romance-driven game, regardless of game mechanics used.
  </li>
<li><strong>Nakige </strong>- A game that produces emotional catharisis (touching your heart, making you cry, etc),
    with a good ending. Think of games like Clannad.
  </li>
</ul>

<img alt src="./kwaxefnhqm9jhcfzt79p.jpg"/>
<ul class="sc-1lmbno3-0 dpuHif" data-style="Bullet" data-type="List">
<li><strong>Utsuge</strong> - games that are made with the intent of making you depressed, kinda like how nakige is to
    make you cry.
  </li>
<li><strong>Moege</strong> - A VN where the focus is on Moe (not even going to try defining moe....)</li>
<li><strong>Charage </strong>- Sub-genre of Moege where the focus is on character development</li>
<li><strong>Eroge</strong> - An eroge (エロゲー or エロゲ erogē); is a portmanteau of the words erotic game. This is a
    blanket term for any game that includes NSFW content.
  </li>
<li><strong>Nukige</strong> - A sub-genre of Visual Novels which focus on the erotic content.</li>
<li><strong>Harem </strong>- A trope characterized by a protagonist surrounded by three or more members of the
    opposing sex who are usually love interests. Harem usually refers to a male protagonist with female love interests,
    while stuff with females with male love interests are referred to as reverse harem. Occurs in manga and anime as
    well.
  </li>
<li><strong>Bishōjo game</strong> - This term designates any game involving a male lead dating pretty anime girls. The
    word “bishōjo” literally means “pretty young girl”. “Girl game” and “gal game” are also used to describe this
    sub-genre. Not really used here in the west.
  </li>
</ul>

<img alt src="./gnzrxd34adcnmnxmd1ht.jpg"/>
<ul class="sc-1lmbno3-0 dpuHif" data-style="Bullet" data-type="List">
<li><strong>Otome game - </strong>This term designates any romantic game involving a female lead... so the exact
    opposite. Translated literally, Otome game means “maiden game”. They are also referred to as a “reverse harem”.
  </li>
<li><strong>Boy’s Love game</strong> - This term designates any game involving a male lead dating pretty anime boys in
    a homosexual relationship. “BL game” and “Yaoi” are terms also used to describe these games. This sub-genre is
    primarily geared toward a female audience.
  </li>

</h2><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">In conclusion, the Visual Novel genre is unlike anything else; a video game genre
  solely focused on storytelling, but not a book or show because of the presentation and interaction. The reason why VNs
  are great are because they enable you to experience amazing stories in a way you will not find elsewhere. I love them
  for that, and I hope you do too. If you see anything missing, post it in the comments and I’ll update this post.</p>
