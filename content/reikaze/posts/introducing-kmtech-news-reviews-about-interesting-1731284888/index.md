<div><img alt src="./1435414696522860839.png"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Technology. It’s a field aiming for the best, always making leaps and bounds to
  push the boundaries, but along the disruption on the high end, there’s a much less talked about aspect that’s just as
  disruptive... the race to the bottom, where engineering pushes better tech cheaper and cheaper. This is KMTech, my new
  blog which’ll cover interesting tech products aimed at the Next Billion.</p>

<img alt src="./hhrqm7cgxg0nmul969gz.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Like my RockmanDash Reviews blog, it’s another blog covering things I find
  interesting, but unlike my RockmanDash Reviews blog which was primarily about Visual Novels, KMTech will be focused on
  news and reviews of import electronics. It’ll be about interesting yet awesome products that don’t break the bank,
  while not managing to suck in the process. </p><h3 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h112840"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>What’s the purpose of KMTech?</h3><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">This answer is
  three-pronged: </p>
<ol class="sc-1lmbno3-1 sizyJ" data-style="Number" data-type="List">
<li>I’m a really big fan of tech hardware in general, and because of this, I’ve always wanted to do Tech Reviews. I
    want to keep my RockmanDash Reviews blog focused on spreading the word of VNs, so I’m making KMTech for the tech
    half of my blogging.<br/></li>
<li>Technology, expecially in the low end has gotten very interesting lately, and there’s not a lot of people in the
    west covering this material.... so like my VN stuff. This blog is going to be aimed at covering this overlooked
    aspect of technology, something really lacking in the west.
  </li>
<li>I was recently asked by <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","http://www.gearbest.com/",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://www.gearbest.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GearBest.com</a></span>,
    an import retailer if I could do reviews of their products after they read my<em> Teclast X98 Air II </em>review,
    and I couldn’t really say no. Because of this agreement though, I’ll be doing a lot of articles about this, so I
    didn’t want to flood the blogs i’m affiliated with. (I will be doing my early news posts around the place to get
    people’s attention and sharing stuff when relevant, but after that I’ll try to keep it on KMTech.)
  </li>

<h3 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h112841"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>Regarding Reviews</h3><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">On KMTech, I’m receiving products (books, etc) from GearBest free of charge,. If provided,
  these products are for the sole purpose of reviewing the product, and while I do recieve monitary compensation for
  these articles and reviews, the money is from GearBest, a retailer that has no influence on the product itself, and
  will not influence how I review the product. I will not accept any compensation, monetary or other, in order to
  influence a reviews outcome.</p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">If you want a more specific explaination of the review methodology, I’ll be making a
  post like my RockmanDash Reviews Methodology which will reflect how it’s done here.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">
  If you have any questions about this policy or one of our reviews, please email me at Kevinmai813@gmail.com or comment

<h3 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h112842"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a><strong>Where You Can Find
  KMTech</strong><br/></h3><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">You can find KMTech on my kinja blog <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","http://kmtech.kinja.com/#_ga=1.79144861.888615642.1438970662",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://kmtech.kinja.com/#_ga=1.79144861.888615642.1438970662" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">KMTech.kinja.com</a></span>,
  on the XDA Developer Forum, and on YouTube @ KMTech. I’ll probably branch out and make social media pages, but that
  isn’t at the table at the moment.</p>
