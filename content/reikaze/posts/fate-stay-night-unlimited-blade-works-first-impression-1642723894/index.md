  It's fantastic.<br/> <br/></p>

<img alt src="940934613098786190.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> Let's get this off the bat: Ufotable's done a brilliant job with the visuals. It's
  one of the best out there, and I dare say that it is the best. The insane attention to detail, the atmosphere, the
  fluid art, the effects, the beautiful lighting (By far the best lighting in anime imo), the brilliant camera
  movement... it's really beautiful. Only a few animation studios can really nail it this well. It's really complete;
  you can take a screenshot of any frame and it'll look beautiful. The Scenery is up there with <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://rockmandash12.kinja.com/rockmandash-reviews-nagi-no-asukara-anime-1567969970",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://rockmandash12.kinja.com/rockmandash-reviews-nagi-no-asukara-anime-1567969970" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nagi no Asukara</a></span>, and the character art is up to par with the best <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","Internal link","http://tay.kotaku.com/rockmandash-reviews-kara-no-kyoukai-the-garden-of-si-1524615358",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://tay.kotaku.com/rockmandash-reviews-kara-no-kyoukai-the-garden-of-si-1524615358">Kara no Kyoukai films</a></span>.
  The visuals in this anime, nail the atmosphere in a way the original VN couldn't. The way it handles some of the
  scenes like Rin's summoning of archer is infinitely better than the VN, and I'm really enjoying it.</p>

<div class="ooo3c9-0 PpIMM align--bleed has-video media-large video-embed embed-frame"><span class="flex-video widescreen"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ptou8WtFOQM" width="560"></iframe><span class="js_recommend" data-chomp-id="ptou8WtFOQM" data-recommend-id="youtube://ptou8WtFOQM" data-recommended="false" id="youtube-ptou8WtFOQM"></span></span></div><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> The soundtrack is just as amazing as I thought it would be, and I'm a fan. It's
  beautifully composed, and it's used well in creating an amazing atmosphere and mood. It's pleasing to the ear and it
  sounds great. It sounds much more fitting to F/SN than the soundtrack did before; the new tracks fit the atmosphere
  well and the remixes fit much better, giving the show a more accurate tone, but I still really like the 2012
  soundtrack. 1 thing I have to say here though is that it's a lot more subtle than I was expecting, especially when you
  compare it to the really overbearing 2012 soundtrack for FSN and Mahoutsukai no Yoru's soundtrack, and this is
  probably the part that differs the most from the VN. The tracks so far are amazing, and I'm looking forward to where
  it's going from here.</p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> Also, about the OP and ED: I think Ideal White is a great OP, but it's not my
  favorite, especially in comparison to the Realta Nua OP, or even in comparison to disillusion.. but that's my
  Type-Moon Fanboy screaming at you. As for the ED believe, it's good. It's kalafina so of course it's good, but I don't
  think it's as good as some of the other stuff they have made.</p><h3 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h114538"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>Episode 0 - Prologue</h3>
<img alt src="940934613327064462.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> Episode 0 was an hour long, beautiful straightforward adaptation of the prologue:
  It was amazing, and Rin=Best girl. Ufotable did a great job in capturing the tension, showing Rin's thoughts/emotions
  well, and it showed the relationship between Rin and Archer extremely well. The more light hearted part of the prequel
  was handled well (Rin's expressions with Shinji were golden), and the more serious parts were extremely good. I loved
  the amount of camera angles in the episode, as it really helps to the show. It's a big difference between the static
  VN and I appreciated it. Also, The Lancer and Archer fight was amazing... it's so fluid, fast and pretty... my jaws
  were on the floor when I saw that. Overall, I was pretty impressed with this episode... really impressed. It was
  amazing, and every bit of it was done extremely well.</p><h3 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h114539"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>Episode 1 - Winter Days, A Fateful Night</h3>
<img alt src="letkk4l33msrrp94mblh.png"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Episode 1 was also an hour long, and it it was the first bit of the VN, the part
  that's pretty much consistent with every route, up until the end where there's the shift into the UBW arc. It's the
  same block of time that the prologue is, but under the viewpoint of Shirou. This episode was pretty good as well, but
  I don't think it was nearly as good as Ep 0. Most of it was just the slice of life for Shirou, with the expressions of
  Shirou and Taiga done really well. What really stole the show however, was backstory scene with Kiritsugu, and it
  makes for a better transition from F/Z to F/SN. Also... the Lancer vs Saber fight was unbelievable, especially when
  Lancer used his gae bulge... They visualized that incredibly well and I love it. I'm pretty sure I'm going to be blown
  away with every fight scene in this... Looking forward to the rest :D</p><h3 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h114540">
<a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>Something's different....</h3>
<img alt src="rfqvflj9133oqcpqr90a.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> I really enjoyed these.. but there's something that just didn't feel right about it
  to me. It's hard to put into words, but it doesn't have the same feel as the VN, and there's some bits that just
  felt... off. Not bad, per se, but it just didn't feel right. I can't really pinpoint what exactly, but it just feels
  weird to me. </p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> If you've been hearing it's extremely accurate to the VN, the people
  who are telling you that is wrong. There's a lot of subtle differences that make it different, and it adds up. To give
  an example, the VN doesn't really explain why Rin's clocks are an hour ahead, they just state it is; the anime does
  this and I appreciated it. Another example is that Rin's discussion with Archer about command seals took place in her
  room, not her dad's office. There's A LOT of those little scene changes like that, so it totally changes the show.</p>

<img alt src="./lf2exn3gexh4qj1fzfmr.jpg"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> Another thing is that the anime doesn't have a lot of the the inner monologue
from the who's the protagonist. So far, the show's handling it pretty well, so it isn't really a big deal, but this
kinda changes the the feeling of the story completely; I don't feel like I'm with the protagonist, I feel like an
observer. I feel like it'll have more monologue as we go on, but as is, it's different. </p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> It may be the music. Like I said before, the soundtrack is totally different, and
  it creates a different mood. The mood was essential to F/SN and this change may be throwing me off.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> I feel like it's missing something so far.. Maybe it's the inner monologue, maybe it's the
  music, but it feels off. I mean, It's still great, but it's definitely different and it feels kinda off to me. I hope
  that i'm not the only one who feels this way.</p>
<h3 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h114541"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>Overall</h3>
<img alt src="nzoiadvovbveeefhqjsm.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">What do I think about F/SN so far? It's been amazing, and you guys should definitely
  check it out. There's a few things that are done differently than I expected, but it's done very well and it's really
  a must watch. If you want to see some of the best visuals, with some of the best action scenes out there, and great
  music, or just a solid show overall without a ton of fanservice... here ya go. It's going to be amazing. </p>
