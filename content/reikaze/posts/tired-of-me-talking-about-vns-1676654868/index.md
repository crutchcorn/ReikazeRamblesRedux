Well, too bad! I'll keep on talking about them.. and this time, actually talking! I was recently invited to be a guest on a Visual Novel Podcast called FuwaFM, and the topic of the podcast was one of my favorite games,* Ever 17: The Out of Infinity *(My personal review is down below).

I had fun with this one, and I hope you guys (if interested) give it a shot! I may be in more of these FuwaFM podcasts in the future.
