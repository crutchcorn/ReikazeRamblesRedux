Well, too bad! I'll keep on talking about them.. and this time, actually talking! I was recently invited to be a guest on a Visual Novel Podcast called FuwaFM, and the topic of the podcast was one of my favorite games, *Ever 17: The Out of Infinity* (My personal review is down below).

That being said, It's full of spoilers (like, what podcast isn't though?), and it may help lessen the blow that there will be no December[ AniTAY Podcast Episode](http://anitay.kinja.com/ani-tay-podcast-episode-9-spoil-all-the-things-1668096686). I had fun with this one, and I hope you guys (if interested) give it a shot! I may be in more of these FuwaFM podcasts in the future.
