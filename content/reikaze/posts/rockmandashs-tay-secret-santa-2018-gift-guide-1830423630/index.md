Hello! It’s been a while since I did a secret santa , but I’m definitely down for it this year and looking forward to it!\
\
Here’s what I’d like - I’m a huge addict to the switch and I’m getting a ps4 so games for those would be appreciated. Here’s my backloggery so you don’t get a game I already have: <https://backloggery.com/rockmandash12>. I’m a jrpg /anime/ vn /retro gaming dork so stuff in related to that would be preferred. Cheap figures [from anime I like](https://myanimelist.net/animelist/Rockmandash12) would be cool or game merch from series I like would be neat.

***

Favorite game series: Zero Escape/Infinity. I’m a pretty big fan of the trails series ,Y s, Megaman ,Soni c and a ton of VN series I’ve gushed about.

Systems I Own: (basically everything) PC, NES, SNES, N64, Wii, Wii U, Switch, Sega Master System, Sega Genesis, Sega Saturn, Sega Dreamcast, Xbox, Xbox 360, PS1, PS2, PS3, getting a ps4 soon.
