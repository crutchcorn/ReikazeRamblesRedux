<div><img alt src="./ouwv0gg3ifaeoteqjif6.png"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Whenever I see a comedy harem show, I immediately think it's one of two things:
  An enjoyable yet really stupid show that I can't help but love, or a show that's executed poorly. Today, we have <em>Invaders
    of the Rokujyouma!?</em>, a comedy harem adapted by Silver Link that just so happens to be the latter, but has hints
  of the first catagory.</p>

<img alt src="./bgvqz6d306aojzqgj57k.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> While <em>Invaders</em> is very much a harem that does nothing special, the
  characters that it has are still very enjoyable. All of them fall into a specific trope with a small twist but I
  couldn't help but smile when I saw them interact with each other. We have Kotarou, our harem protagonist who isn't a
  pervert or an idiot, a tsundere ghost named Sanae who's reactions are thoroughly enjoyable, a land lady named Shizuka
  who has an insane wrath, and the list goes on. They are all basic yet enjoyable, which helps keep the show
  entertaining, even when the plot falls apart. The interactions with each other are what keeps this show interesting,
  and I really enjoyed them.<br/> <br/> Also, I think Yurika deserves her own paragraph. As an airhead magical girl who
  consistently gets mocked as a cosplayer, she's consistently trotting through failure. Her reactions and personality
  throughout the show were the show enjoyable, endearing and entertaining, and it made her my favorite character by a
  long shot. I just wish that the characters (other than Kotarou because of MC OP'ness) knew that she was actually a
  magical girl and took her seriously. </p><h4 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h109204"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>Solid Ending</h4>
<img alt src="./pbxvkqzkxrifw0fyzou7.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> The last episode of Invaders was a return to form that explained a lot about
  Kotarou's abilities, while being really enjoyable in general. If every episode was like this, I'd love it, but that's
  not the case. Because of this ending, this show may be more enjoyable in a marathon, and if you are interested in the
  show, I'd recommend you do so.</p>

I found
  that Silver Link did a nice job every now and then in this show, but most of it was pretty normal. The show does the
  reactions pretty well, the characters look pleasing to the eye, it has good lighting overall and the world looks
  pretty solid, but it never blew my mind. As for the music itself, it was pretty solid, but it sits in the background,
  never drawing attention to itself. Once you pay attention to the soundtrack it's actually quite entertaining, but it
  does nothing special.</p>
<h4 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h109206"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>Hilarious, then disappointing.

<img alt src="./odza38wcpvi8xznom2mn.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> I loved <em>Invaders</em> at the beginning. A harem with the room as the target of
  said harem, with the protagonist at the side? Silly and entertaining games with nonstop comedy? Unfortunately, it was
  too good to be true. 1/3rd of the way through the show, they dropped that whole idea completely, and made it into a
  run of the mill, typical harem show. The antics for the room were done well, and were quite enjoyable and I wish they
  kept doing that.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> When they stopped doing that I was disappointed. They switched into
  a more traditional harem approach which was more character focused, and because this wasn't done too well, I didn't
  enjoy it as much. They have running jokes and character interactions which try to keep it entertaining, and I'd never
  say that Invaders is a horrible show. It's sometimes frustrating, and it's wasted potential, but it's never
  rubbish.</p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> Simply put, the show isn't made for something like a character drama. These are
  characters that are pretty much archetypes, and by taking away the humor for character development, they ruins the
  direction of the show and made it much less enjoyable. The fact that they went away from the "room has a harem
  including the main character" concept to a normal harem bothered me, but to try shipping every girl to him in a way
  that's not particularly good bothered me even more.</p>
<img alt src="./vcpd8tbvtmhntgpsuo0r.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> What kills it are the harem antics and bad writing. They try to ship Kotarou to
  everyone, and they try to develop these characters, but neither of them works out well. An Example is episode 9, where
  they develop the relatively static Yurika pretty well... and everyone finally acknowledges she's a magical girl, but
  then EVERYONE'S MEMORY GETS REVERTED. Why.... What reason do they have to do that? Every arc has some issue like this,
  and it bothers me to no end. Every arc also has Kotarou being and being the perfect match for all of these girls, with
  an insane amount of plot armor, which really detracts from the show. Even though the explanation at the end explains
  quite a bit about this and makes it less irritating, it doesn't excuse the experience of having to go through that BS.
  This show would have been so much better if they stuck to the comedy.</p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><em>Invaders of the Rokujyouma!?</em> is another comedy harem show that has let me
  down, once again. It shows potential, and was enjoyable, but it stopped doing what I loved about it, and the writing
  fell apart. The ending puts a band-aid on it, but it could have been done better, and I wish it was done better.</p>
