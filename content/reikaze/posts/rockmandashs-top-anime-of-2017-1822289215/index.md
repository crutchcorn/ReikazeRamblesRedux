  help but look back at the positives, the best of the best. This includes anime, and I thought I’d chip in my 2 cents
  on what I thought were the best this year, My Top anime of 2017.<br/></p>

</h3>
<img alt src="./mabiy0adexmdwhiga9dm.png"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">My rules of this list are simple: if it aired/released this year, it can go on this
  list. I don’t see the point in only giving a show one chance during it’s airing season, and this is my list so I’ll
  list my favorite shows regardless of what season it started on. If this means that one show hogs the top spot for 2
  seasons, than good for that show! If it’s an OVA or movie that came out during the duration of the season I fell in
  love with, then it may be there. I think that the seasonal split is arbitrary and unnecessary, so it’s completely gone
  here. Sorry about that, but that’s how I’m doing it.<br/></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><br/>Just an FYI, the
  placement of the show in the list is mostly based on my experience and enjoyment of the work, so if you’re wondering
  why something isn’t where you think it should be or you can’t really tell via the justification, that’s probably why.
  Keep in mind, just because a show is lower on the list doesn’t mean it’s bad - all of these are great, and a lower
  placement isn’t a mark against the show, at this point it’s nearly all personal preference. With that out of the way,
  let’s get started!</p>

  on Anime in 2017:</h3>
<img alt src="./yce0ajyzqober08ceirw.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">To be honest, I was pretty underwhelmed by anime in 2017. After the amazing winter
  season, there was nothing that really grabbed me, nothing that kept me consistently watching anime and as a result, I
  lapsed in my anime watching significantly. A part of this is due to the fact that many shows I was interested were
  locked in the double paywall that was amazon strike, which as a poor college student I really couldn’t justify paying
  for. I could pirate, sure, but I don’t typically watch on a laptop or desktop, and mobile apps and sites for pirating
  services usually suck ass... so I just watched less anime. RIP<br/><br/>That being said, there were some damn great
  movies that came out in 2017, and I loved seeing them.<em> Fate/stay night Heaven’s feel</em>, <em>Silent Voice</em>
  &amp;<em> Your Name.</em> (which I think of it more as a 2016 anime bc saw at AX and thus won’t be on this list) were
  all fantastic and as someone who loves anime movies I hope other years will be as great as this was for anime movies.

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Justification &amp; Thoughts: </strong>I love <em>Ancient Magus Bride</em>,
  a modern day fantasy show that is absolutely stunning, but it’s an honorable mention because it failed to do something
  that I feel like is mandatory to be in my top lists: <em>AMB</em> failed to compel me in a manner that gets me to
  watch the show every week, to be fully engaged and invested in the show. <em>AMB </em>is actually the reason that this
  list is late (I’m still not caught up :|), but it is definitely worth a watch thanks to its stunning visual design
  &amp; animation (I feel obligated to watch on my TV because of it), its fantastic setting and an amazing cast. It’s a
  great watch, but it’s just not all that gripping.</p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Justification &amp; Thoughts: </strong><em>Recovery of an MMO Junkie</em> is
  one of the best romances this year in anime, and that’s not because it does anything outlandish, but because of how
  grounded it is to reality. <em>MMO</em> shows a side of life that isn’t typically shown in anime - romance in life
  past high school and the results of the harsh realities that is being an adult, with a touch of recovering from
  depression and video games. With an amazing lead heroine, great character dynamics and a fun romance, it’s definitely
  worth a watch<br/></p>

    Plot Summary from MAL</em></strong></p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Justification &amp; Thoughts: </strong><em>Saekano </em>is my jam, and one
  of my favorite series to come out of the last few years. As a person who loves Visual Novels, loves to hear about
  people making things, loves romantic comedies and loves dramas, <em>Saekano</em> is the exact type of show I would
  fall in love with, and thanks to it’s absolutely fantastic execution, I certainly have. Add to the fact that <em>Saekano </em>shares
  shares many of the strengths that made White Album 2 great because they were made by the same person (Maruto Fumiaki)
  and what you have left is a very compelling and enjoyable watch, one I fell in love with.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">While at the beginning Season 2 seemed like more of<em> Best Girl: The Animation</em> with
  entertaining dialogue, harem antics and meta humor all over the place (which I still loved, mind you because its damn
  enjoyable), Season 2 finally kicked into what one would expect from Maruto Fumiaki. In <em>Saekano S2</em>, everything
  about the perfect harem setting starts to fall apart, and in it’s place we have a fantastic and engaging drama that is
  built on well developed characters in an engaging premise. We see everything we loved from the first season be
  enhanced while <em>Saekano</em> becomes a much better show as a whole with more meaningful interactions between
  characters and a more gripping story in general. This is a work that shows the viewer the impacts of what it means to
  put your heart and soul into a creative process, what it means to work with others as a team, on creating something
  and the impacts of working in a team on such a creative work has as a whole. Ultimately, it’s still not a<em> White
    Album 2</em> of romantic perfection as it still overdosing on ecchi and silly antics given it’s harem meta anime
  roots, but it’s one of my favorite anime, and I definitely encourage you to give it a shot if you think you’d be
  interested in it.</p>

  Summary: </strong><em>Fate/stay night </em>follows Emiya Shirou as he is dragged into a fight-to-the-death tournament
  called The Fifth Holy Grail War, where people known as Masters fight with heroes throughout history, known as
  Servants, for a chance to get the wish-granting Holy Grail. In <em>Heaven’s Feel-Presage Flowe</em>r however, this all
  just serves as a backdrop to a more personal story, as <em>Heaven’s Feel</em> has always been a significant subversion
  in comparison to the rest of <em>Fate/stay night</em>,<em> </em>and we should see some of that come to play near
  the end of<em> Presage flower</em>. <em>Fate/stay night </em>as a whole is a story about ideals and heroism, what it
  truly means to be a hero... but unlike the other routes, <em>Heaven’s Feel </em>challenges the core concept of hero
  and the realities of it. Fans of <em>Zero</em> will be right at home, and everyone else will be here for a

</p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Justification &amp; Thoughts: </strong>To me, there are 2 types of good
  adaptations: the first is to make a work better than the original, with the primary goal to create a great work that
  stands on its own right, even if it isn’t accurate to the source. The second, is to create a work that is focused more
  on accuracy, not to translate a work scene by scene or whatever, but to create a work that captures the essence of
  what made the original great try to transplant the experience of the original work in the new medium.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">In my opinion, while none of the other<em> Fate/stay night</em> anime managed to do either
  of these, <em>Presage Flower</em> definitely does, fitting squarely into the second type of good adaptation. The
  original visual novel presented an experience unlike anything else i’ve played and it had a profound impact on me and
  how I view the world around me. To see someone that really understands the work, to see someone really put effort into
  portraying the essence and experience of the best route in <em>Fate/stay night</em>... to see ufotable do<em>

    Heaven’s feel</em> acts as a fascinating subversion of the other parts of <em>Fate/stay night</em>, so you do need
  to see the previous parts of <em>Fate/stay night</em> before you watch<em> Heaven’s feel</em>, but if you have, what
  you’ll get out of<em> Fate/stay night Heaven’s Feel Presage Flower</em> is a well developed cast of characters, some
  of the best visuals in the industry with ufotable on a movie budget, a fantastic soundtrack from Yuki Kajiura, and a
  gripping story, even if it’s only a 3rd of the complete work that is <em>Heaven’s feel</em>, and is a tad bit rushed

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Justification &amp; Thoughts: </strong>Tanya was a really fun, engaging
  ride. Like the character Tanya herself, Saga of Tanya the Evil the show overcame all exceptions, even as the system
  was rigged against it’s favor. A show with a loli as a main character in a boring and grey war show, made with a brand
  new studio... nothing good could have come out of it, but it managed to be amazing. What we got was a fascinating
  alternate history twist on world war 1 with our main character not being your typical little girl, but a deeply
  logical Japanese businessman turned into a little girl and facing a relentless battle against god, aka being X! Seeing
  this conflict was extremely entertaining, adding onto the enjoyment that comes from Tanya as a character, and the
  amazingly animated fights bring the show into another level, with this being one of my favorite action anime of the
  year. All and all, a stellar show.</p>

    Summary from MAL</strong></em></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Justification &amp; Thoughts:</strong>
  Honestly, While I enjoyed the manga of <em>Silent Voice and</em> knew it was pretty good, I wasn’t really sure what to
  expect from the movie of <em>Silent Voice</em>, given all the hype from everyone on the internet. Even though I saw
  the source though, that didn’t lessen the impact of the work for me: KyoAni pulled some movie magic and made a
  gripping and compelling work, great in basically every way except one. <br/><br/>For me, the pinnacle of a movie
  experience is being immersed in a human story, and when I witnessed the believable characters faced in a gut wrenching
  yet ultimately realistic situation, I couldn’t help but felt engaged and entranced, to the point that I was crying in
  the theaters. The production values were absolutely supurb as KyoAni on a movie budget lead to some absolutely jaw
  dropping scenes, the voice acting, while not to everyone’s tastes was very effective, and the story was compelling and
  thought provoking, getting me to walk out of the theaters thinking about how actions effect the lives of others. My
  one real issue with the movie though, is that it’s a movie: the story is structured in a serialized manner, and the
  adaptation can’t change that. So, what we got with the movie adaptation of Silent voice was a series of peaks and
  valleys, with no real satisfying rising action in the story. It felt like KyoAni should have made this a TV anime, but
  it’s still a great movie and a must watch.<br/></p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Justification &amp; Thoughts:</strong> It would not be an understatement to
  say that<em> Rakugo</em> is one of the best shows I’ve ever seen. Season 1 was phenomenal; a beautiful and extremely
  well executed historical drama that absolutely took me and the AniTAY community by surprise. While <em>Rakugo</em>’s
  premise might not strike you as something you’d be interested in watching because it’s simply telling stories, where
  <em>Rakugo </em>shines is the brilliant execution: how it tells the story is what that makes this great, being able to
  handle all of its elements extremely well. The show has fantastic pacing, solid visuals, a great score, amazing
  characters and the best part: it’s consistently engaging with every episode being better than the last.<br/><br/>Season
  2 was more of<em> Rakugo </em>Season 1 which is great, but Season 2 made a fundamental change that takes away from
  what made me love the show so much, thus the placement at 3 for this year. Season 1 of R<em>akugo </em>was a
  historical set piece, a flashback to a time when master Yakumo was growing up, in one of my favorite settings. Going
  from a historical coming of age to a more modern story following a yotaro/former criminal as he does rakugo... it
  wasn’t exactly what I was hoping for. Definitely worth a watch, and the ending is phenomenal, but it isn’t as golden
  as Rakugo Season 1.</p>

  tells the story of Kazuma, a shut-in otaku NEET. Following his sudden death and rebirth into a new fantasy world,
  Kazuma thought that his new life would be that of an amazing video game hero. However, this fantasy world quickly
  proved that not to be the case. Kazuma is paired up with useless allies, has mediocre stats, and every time he does
  something good it seems to just cause more problems for him. After living in this world for a while, he thought that
  he might grow used to things, but this too is clearly not the case. To make matters worse, after narrowly defending
  the town from a roving Ancient Weapon/Natural Disaster, Kazuma inadvertently teleported the exploding core of the
  machine to an aristocrat’s mansion. Now he is suspected of treason. Will his fantasy life ever stop trying to screw

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Justification &amp; Thoughts: </strong>KO - NO - SU - BA! Spending time with
  these lovable idiots in Konosuba is always a blast, but with season 2<em>, Konosuba</em> is a contender for the best
  comedy that anime has to offer. Every moment is a blast to watch, and this show had me laughing harder than I thought
  I could thanks to great character dynamics, hilarious subversions from the fantasy isekai tropes, and entertaining
  hijinks at every corner. While the animation quality might have dipped, they use the animation more effectively, to
  make the gags better, to make the show more entertaining, and it really worked. Every moment, every episode had my
  laughing, and I was always looking forward to the newest episode of this show. I don’t think I’ve laughed as hard as I
  did with<em> Konosuba </em>this season, and I’m not sure if I will ever again.<br/></p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Justification &amp; Thoughts: </strong><em>Girls’ Last Tour</em> is a show
  that resonates with me, and I truly felt in love with it, in a manner that screamed to me AOTY, and quite possibly a
  place in my top 10 anime list. It ticks a lot of boxes: <em>Girls Last Tour</em> is a fantastic post apocalyptic slice
  of life adventure (things I would enjoy by themselves) and thanks to an absolutely amazing execution, we got an
  incredibly fun yet meaningful show to watch. The slice of life that makes the show feel easy to digest, but it’s also
  fascinating and engaging in a meaningful manner thanks to the post apocalyptic setting that is thought provoking and
  keeps you asking questions throughout. The real core of the story is the characters though, like all good slice of
  life shows are: while we only really focus on our 2 lead characters, they felt like real human beings in a fascinating
  situation of growing up in a post apocalyptic setting, really unknown about how the world works due to the lack of
  information in that era, and their interactions between each other were some of the most enjoyable and entertaining
  I’ve seen all year. </p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> It’s production is amazing too. The music perfectly captures
  the atmosphere and mood of the world and scenes it has, the ops and eds are some of the most memorable I’ve seen, and
  the visuals are surprisingly good. Ultimately this show looks a bit basic due to the moe blob art style (which I
  actually loved because it served to get me to love the characters more as I thought it was very fitting and
  endearing), but the world that<em> GLT</em> portrays is absolutely jaw dropping at times and it has some of the best
  visual directing I’ve seen in anime. The way that they tease the next topic by hiding it on screen in previous scenes,
  the way they they provide visual information in a natural manner is superb and lead to <em>Girls’ Last Tour</em>
  looking way better than it’s blobs suggest it should be.<br/> But if you asked me what was the best part about <em>Girls’
    Last Tour</em>, I would have to say how consistently compelling it is. At all moments, this work is compelling,
  endearing, entertaining and engaging - never was there a moment that I didn’t enjoy with this work (both actually
  watching the show or thinking about the mysteries that the show constructs). So many of the decisions made in this
  show fit exactly what I love, and I loved this show to no end. Give it a shot! </p>
