<h3 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h107529"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>A Continuation of The Great
  Story</h3>
<img alt src="rnht1e9hucyedije69wy.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Above anything else, <em>The Legend of Heroes: Trails of the Sky SC </em>is a
  continuation of the story that <em>FC </em>sets up, dealing with implications of the cliffhanger at the end of the
  game. <em>SC </em>follows our bracer friend Estelle Bright as she goes around trying to stop the plans of The Society,
  (also known as Ouroboros) who plan on building off the events in the first game and taking it further. While the story
  is structured around The Society and the events they cause, <em>The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky SC </em>is
  really a story of people, focusing on the emotions that Estelle and Joshua go through in their journey to find out the
  truth.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">SC takes everything further, taking what seemed like a relatively basic story
  and fleshing it out to an unbelievable extent. It goes through what you’re expecting, amping up and wrapping up the
  story so it doesn’t end on a cliffhanger, but it goes through so much more as well: it’s a tale of the brightness of
  those working together as we see the bracers and the community try to solve issues as one, but it’s also a sad story
  about the tragedies of a world. We see a touching love story and the creation of new bonds, but we also see people
  dealing with the loss of loved ones. We see the recovery and success of a society, but we also see the dealing with
  the aftermath of war and death. We have our heroes dedicated to save everything, confronting the enemies so convinced
  of their goals that they would be willing to massacre a complete society. It’s really a complete package, and it keeps
  the work interesting and varied while feeling compelling throughout. </p>

<img alt src="./xksl8z3ie6agw8dgjpz6.jpg"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Even though <em>Trails in the Sky SC </em>touches on many things, it never feels
forced and it works because it uses all these things it covers to strengthen the main narrative. These are elements
that make the world feel real - while obviously a fantasy scenario in a fantasy world, because of it’s focus on people
and humanity, it feels like these people are alive and in a living and breathing world with so much going on. Everyone
has a voice and a story to tell, with their own concerns and livelihoods. The world isn’t focused on you so much as
the fact that as you’re existing in a fleshed out and thriving world that moves along and reacts to what happens
around you, a world that feels truly real.</p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">The world itself is interesting too, being a blend of your typical fantasy with a
  twist of semi futuristic sci fi to make a world that kinda feels like our modern world, but a world that feels
  completely unique. It has tons of lore and is one that’s deeply fleshed out in this game, a world that only adds to
  one’s experience with the game. There’s so much here, from the differences to how things are powered with this world
  controlled by orbit power instead of being run by the combustion engine like in ours, and cultural things like how
  people have the god Adios and pretty much say Adios when people would say God in our world.</p>
<img alt src="hqrh3aq9kotd72okvvom.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> Of course though, above the thematic aspects and world building is the dialogue
  that holds the story together, the writing that makes it feel like the world is complete... and like before, it’s
  really good here. With the main cast, the way the characters react to each other makes them feel truly real, and it’s
  always a blast to read. The relationships between the characters are fleshed out and engaging with witty and amusing
  dialogue,and it’s supported with interactions and charm that never cease to put a smile on your face. The main cast is
  absolutely amazing with stellar backstories, they have personalities that are well developed, they are likable and
  aren’t static, and the game really makes you care for the cast as much as they care for themselves. It’s just great
  writing here to the point that the main duo, Estelle and Joshua, became some of my favorite characters in JRPGs. The
  writing props extend to the NPCs as well - everyone has unique dialogue that changes, and it makes for a story and
  world that feels really polished.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><em>The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky
  SC </em>has a<em> </em>story that’s written well enough and is long enough to be a Visual Novel (for reference, its
  script is 716,401 words, longer than books like <em>War and Peace </em>and RPGs like <em>FF7, </em>but shorter than
  VNs like <em>Fate/stay night </em>and <em>Clannad), </em>which is kind of amazing considering it’s an RPG. SC makes an
  living and breathing world out of this fact to add to an amazing story, one that sucks you in and keeps you engaged
  and one that had me playing it pretty much nonstop for like a week because I was so hooked. If you liked RPG stories
  in the past like <em>Chrono Trigger </em>and <em>Grandia </em>but wanted more, something that is more in depth and
  feels like you’re in a real world, then here you go... this is the most complete RPG style story I’ve ever experienced
  and it’s just amazing, an execution on a tried and true story that is absolutely gold.</p>
<h3 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h107530"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>This Game Has a Heart</h3>
<img alt src="tgs45ehfye6xhrt5pwpv.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Talk to anyone who’s played this game and you’ll hear lots of love. When one sees
  all these comments then tries to look at a game objectively or without experiencing it, they may say that this game
  doesn’t really stand out, even to the point that they believe it’s another generic JPRG, but that totally misses the
  point. The reasons people fall in love with games like this, the games that are known as cult classics are the
  intangibles, the character and charm that they have to offer, the elements that create an emotional bond with the
  characters and keep the game memorable. One can tell there was a lot of love and care put into the work, and <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","Internal link","http://kotaku.com/the-curse-of-kiseki-how-one-of-japans-biggest-rpgs-bar-1740055631?trending_test_five_c&amp;utm_expid=66866090-76.Xf7HV5ZSS3i8CtAkjmzQiA.3&amp;utm_referrer=http%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Ftag%2Ftrails-in-the-sky%3Ftrending_test_five_c",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://kotaku.com/the-curse-of-kiseki-how-one-of-japans-biggest-rpgs-bar-1740055631?trending_test_five_c&amp;utm_expid=66866090-76.Xf7HV5ZSS3i8CtAkjmzQiA.3&amp;utm_referrer=http%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Ftag%2Ftrails-in-the-sky%3Ftrending_test_five_c">when reading what they’ve gone through to make this possible here in the west</a></span>,
  this feeling only goes up more. <em>Trails in the Sky SC </em>feels distinct and unique because of this, and it’s
  climbed up my favorites list <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","Internal link","http://thebests.kotaku.com/the-best-jrpg-of-the-decade-so-far-1743320035#_ga=1.22380216.241020698.1444271310",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://thebests.kotaku.com/the-best-jrpg-of-the-decade-so-far-1743320035#_ga=1.22380216.241020698.1444271310">along with Jason Schreier’s of Kotaku </a></span>because

  best music in the industry. While <em>Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky SC </em>mostly keeps the soundtrack from
  <em>FC </em>with some remixes and new tracks, that’s not really a negative as SC is pretty much just a continuation of
  the story and the soundtrack still does a great job. It’s a soundtrack that does what every great soundtrack does, one
  that makes events exciting and makes playing the game engaging, encapsulating the feeling of the story and the world
  to provide a better experience. It sounds great, it’s used really well to maximize your emotions, and there’s a lot of
  memorable tracks in this score, namely <em>Silver Will </em>and <em>The Whearabouts of Light </em>being some of my
  favorites. It’s a soundtrack that I loved and adored my whole way through, and I bet you’ll love it just as much as I
  did too.</p>
<div class="ooo3c9-0 PpIMM align--bleed has-video media-large video-embed embed-frame"><span class="flex-video widescreen"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yhjXTatF9dE" width="560"></iframe><span class="js_recommend" data-chomp-id="yhjXTatF9dE" data-recommend-id="youtube://yhjXTatF9dE" data-recommended="false" id="youtube-yhjXTatF9dE"></span></span></div><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Also worth noting is the incredible Zanmai score that just brings the awesome of this
  soundtrack to another level. While I couldn’t experience this because I pulled out my PSP to play this game, on the PC
  version you could actually swap the whole soundtrack, with people swapping in the absolutely amazing Zanmai version to
  listen throughout the game. The clip above is from Zanmai and it really makes the music feel alive, music I’d listen
  to all day.... so good.</p>

Better or For Worse</h3>
<img alt src="./fxnnfe62zn6vjb4lftpy.jpg"/>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">That’s not to say that all of <em>Trails in the Sky SC </em>is perfect: if you
  didn’t care for <em>FC, </em>it’s<em> </em>more of the same. That’s to be expected, as it’s a direct continuation of
  the original game to the point that you can transfer your save over but really, <em>SC </em>is just <em>FC</em> but
  amplified. <em>The Legend of Heroes: Trails of the Sky</em> is a love story to old RPGs out there, and that’s exactly
  what you’re getting, like it or not (it even has disk switching!). One might hope that it would jump straight to the
  action, but it starts slow again by making you go through the rounds again, trying to figure out another mystery, and
  going around the country again. Like before, the characters keep it interesting and engaging, but if you didn’t care
  for its old school gameplay or wanted a less text focused story, you won’t get that here.</p>
<img alt src="gqp8i29w5ipawts6zaj7.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">This is most obvious part about this is the gameplay which is still an old school
  <em>Grandia-</em>like affair, so if you liked it back then, you’ll like it now. It’s a game with an action sensitive
  turn based system in a 2.5D arena that is location sensitive, mixed with attacks, magical arts (which use MP which is
  easily replenishable and are delayed) and physical crafts (which use CP and are instant, but are harder to get). It
  has its fair share of positives, with <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","http://tay.kinja.com/the-legend-of-heroes-trails-in-the-sky-is-worth-your-t-1564560412",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://tay.kinja.com/the-legend-of-heroes-trails-in-the-sky-is-worth-your-t-1564560412" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Matt’s review being mostly positive about it</a></span>,
  but personally it’s a bit too slow for my tastes and at times feeling like a slog. One thing that personally bugged me
  about the gameplay is how it forces you to use some characters at points in the game, making you fight with people
  even if you don’t like their style or if they are like 10 levels under your current level (luckily, they level up back
  quickly, but it’s still annoying). Also, while you can get away with minimal grinding for a fair bit of the game, the
  game wants you to do a decent bit of grinding at certain points in time, which is pretty much the bane of my existence
  when it comes to JRPGs and detracted from my experience.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">That being said, this game
  isn’t an old RPG and it does modernize many aspects: if you die, you can just restart the battle itself, many
  situations where characters need to backtrack are done for you (not that backtracking is completely eliminated
  though...), random encounters are totally gone, instead faced with a situation similar to<em> Chrono Trigger</em>,
  there are no arbitrary save points, etc. If you’re a fan of classic JRPGs, you’re gonna love this one as it provides
  everything you want out of an RPG but gets rid of a lot of the BS that they have, but if you prefer newer RPGs or
  action games, this isn’t gonna be your cup of tea.</p>
<h3 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h107533"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>A Charming, but Dated Aesthetic
</h3>
<img alt src="lwu7squijpkgkcpk1pyk.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Let’s be real here: <em>The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky SC </em>is<em> </em>a
  9 year old PSP game, so throw any assumptions away that this is going to be a technical feat in visual fluidity. This
  game reuses pretty much all its assets from <em>FC</em> and it looks perfectly at home for the PSP, a low polygon
  count affair with sprites for a majority of the characters. It doesn’t look bad as the game makes up for a lot of this
  with aesthetic consistency, detail and charm in design <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","http://www.trailsinthesky.com/sc/_images/trouble9.jpg",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://www.trailsinthesky.com/sc/_images/trouble9.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">(see fishing)</a></span>, and solid quality overall, but it’s not the best either, pretty
  middle of the road with visuals. This is something I had absolutely no problem with, and if you’re playing this you’re
  probably OK with how it looks as this game’s intended audience pretty much grew up on this style.</p><h3 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h107534"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>Boss Heavy Ending</h3>
<img alt src="rbidfjskhwojpzu4wj7a.jpg"/>
<h3 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h107535"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a><small><em><strong>Note: This
  picture is not from the end game.</strong></em></small><em><strong> </strong></em></h3><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">
  It’s the big finale, the long stretch! If you thought you could sit around and stroll by at the end, you can’t, as
  you’re faced with what’s essentially a boss rush at the end of the game, the finals, as you will. Like the ending of
  the first game, the situation of the bosses near the end of the game exponentially gets more asinine and absurd,
  leading to frustration, at least for me. (The final boss itself however wasn’t actually that bad. Just a slow and
  tedious boss fight.)</p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">I really wonder who thought it was a good idea to put variations of bosses you’ve
  already played only a little while ago but in a more frustrating package. While this makes sense in a story aspect,
  this really shows how much this game is story first instead of gameplay... throwing hard bosses so close to another
  with frustrating abilities like being able to spawn enemies that can heal the boss themselves then self destruct to
  take like half of your HP away or take control from you the player completely. It’s definitely frustrating to say the
  least, and almost started to make me hate the game I adore.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">The ending itself however
  is pretty satisfying, with no issues. While a tad bit bittersweet in some aspects, it perfectly encapsulates what the
  story has to tell, it’s an engaging and moving ending that really works with the content of the story and is an ending
  that puts some closure to a series that really needed it. (Even though there’s a third chapter, but who knows if we’re
  getting it at this point.)</p>
