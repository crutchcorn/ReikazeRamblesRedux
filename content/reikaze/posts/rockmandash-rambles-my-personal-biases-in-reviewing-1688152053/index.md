<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">I'll start this off by stating I'm an absolute novice and amateur at reviewing
  literature and works of art in general. I have never got an A in an English course ever, and when I was young, I was
  in English as a Second Language courses, so if you read that wrongeverytime article, I'm a polar opposite. I'm not a
  language/english guy, and You will never find deep literary analysis from me, so please don't expect that. I do my
  reviews purely as a hobby: think of my reviews more as a rambling of thoughts from me to you, or a way to imprint my
  thoughts of a show on word, and less about the critical analysis. I do try to look at things more objectively when
  doing a review, but most things I make, I am as an opinion article of some sort, because that's who I am.</p>
<img alt src="./t2z6h8hcqopztfanufob.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">I judge works primarily based on the experience it provides, the thrill, the
  feelings, the emotion are things I love. I am a person who loves to be moved by a story, a person who cares about the
  influences that works have on me and what the work does to me. What does this experience focus really mean? It means
  I'll prioritize aspects like the narrative, the atmosphere/world and emotion more so than other aspects, and I'll
  explain these one at a time. Also, Let me get out of the way that while these are my general opinions and biases, this
  does not hold true all the time and there are shows in my favorites that go against some of these. These aren't my
  definitive thoughts, these are preferences on a work, and it differs from work to work.</p>

</h3>
<img alt src="./acvlqcmxxgy3vpsb6kia.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> A meaningful story is one of the best ways you can influence a person, and a
  strong, cohesive narrative is a must. Due to the fact that I primarily am focused around the experience of a work,
  when it comes to the story, I really care about how the story is told. A cohesive, trilling, well paced, entertaining
  narrative that is told well is something that I look for, and these aspects are much more important to me than the
  characters or the writing itself. Because of this, I love works with a tight narrative, especially thrillers, which do
  a great job at executing the story aspects. </p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Funny thing about this, While people in the gaming community look down on things
  like <em>To the Moon</em> and<em> Stanley Parable </em>because they "aren't games" in the traditional sense, they
  actially fit really well with my narrative, experience oriented focus and really are exactly what I'm looking for.
  They provide an amazing experience, an engaging and thrilling experience that I'm enjoying throughout. You can see

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">This bias has some side effects though: because I'm really sensitive to issues with
  storytelling, I do really poorly with time jumps in a story that occur without any prior notice. I'm fine when they
  have a major event like <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://rockmandash12.kinja.com/rockmandash-reviews-nagi-no-asukara-anime-1567969970",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://rockmandash12.kinja.com/rockmandash-reviews-nagi-no-asukara-anime-1567969970" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Nagi no Asukara</em></a></span> to mark
  it, but when you randomly jump to a different time period without notifying the viewer, the narrative is no longer
  consistent, I just can't stand it (<span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","http://anitay.kinja.com/shin-sekai-yori-is-a-great-believable-coming-of-age-d-1670092196",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://anitay.kinja.com/shin-sekai-yori-is-a-great-believable-coming-of-age-d-1670092196" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Shin Sekai Yori</em></a></span> being a
  prime example here of where it really bothered me). I also have a hard time enjoying works where I have to "turn my
  brain off", works that people enjoy because of the spectacle of it but have stories that don't really matter like <em>Gurren
    Lagann,</em><span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","Internal link","http://tay.kotaku.com/kill-la-kill-the-ani-tay-review-1554090665",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://tay.kotaku.com/kill-la-kill-the-ani-tay-review-1554090665"><em> Kill la Kill</em></a></span><em>,</em>

Works that fuck
  it's storytelling up however, with a bad scene or a bad ending are shows that I do not deal well with and I get
  significantly more annoyed than the shows above. I cannot tolerate events that break my suspension of disbelief, and I
  cannot tolerate anything that takes me out of the story, because that is an absolute failure on storytelling,
  regardless of if fan theories "fix" the ending, because that's not inherently a part of the story telling experience,
  so I get annoyed. A broken, incomplete work will annoy me much more than a bad work, and you can really see this in my
  sentiments on the endings of <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","http://rockmandash12.kinja.com/rockmandash-reviews-remember-11-the-age-of-infinity-1687285802",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://rockmandash12.kinja.com/rockmandash-reviews-remember-11-the-age-of-infinity-1687285802" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Remember 11</em></a></span><em> </em>and<em> </em><span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","http://rockmandash12.kinja.com/rockmandash-reviews-angel-beats-anime-1618928342",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://rockmandash12.kinja.com/rockmandash-reviews-angel-beats-anime-1618928342" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Angel Beats</em></a></span>. &gt;_&gt;</p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">I'm not really sure that I have much to say here, honestly, as this is probably my
  most documented bias... as I tend to mention it everywhere, most apparent in my <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://rockmandash12.kinja.com/rockmandash-reviews-infinity-zero-escape-marathon-w-1664979798",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://rockmandash12.kinja.com/rockmandash-reviews-infinity-zero-escape-marathon-w-1664979798" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reviews of Uchikoshi works</a></span>. I love how works create an
  atmosphere that makes you feel like you are a part of the work, how they manage to pull you in. This is the difference
  between my good and my great, and it's something I find really important. The major effect of this is that i'll pay
  much more attention to a <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","Internal link","http://tay.kotaku.com/music-in-media-part-1-influencing-your-experiences-1654820461",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://tay.kotaku.com/music-in-media-part-1-influencing-your-experiences-1654820461">soundtrack</a></span>
  than most, as the soundtrack is probably the most important element of making a good atmosphere. Also, on this vein, I
  love world building, and worlds that approach aspects like this in general. My love for things like dystopians and
  alternate histories really come into play here, as if they approach a familiar setting that they've tweaked, i'm
  interested in all the changes, which may not be ideal for all shows. I just like an interesting world in general, and
  if you pitch an idea out, you better go all the way in my opinion. *cough* <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","http://anitay.kinja.com/aldnoah-zero-the-ani-tay-review-1637330529",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://anitay.kinja.com/aldnoah-zero-the-ani-tay-review-1637330529" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Aldnoah.Zero</a></span>

</h3>
<img alt src="./mqhr1ljuzhcvhhcq4pg5.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">I love it when a work manages to influence me emotionally, when it clicks with me
  and elicits emotions, from feelz to a crushing depression. If a show makes me smile and happy, I like it, if a show
  makes me feel like a useless person, I tend to really appreciate how they did it, and love the experience of watching
  said show. The harder a punch a work can do, the better it is in my books. Because of this, you can see a general bias
  of mine to romantic comedies, comedies in general, dramas, thrillers, etc, shows that tend to elicit emotions rather
  than genres like action which focus on other aspects. Almost all of my favorites in any of these lists manages to do
  this, as this is an aspect that I really find important, almost a mandatory to become one of my favorites. (Granted,
  I'm a pretty sensitive person so this isn't hard to do at all, but it's worth mentioning.) That being said, this can
  lead to weird things, like how I have quite a fondness twords the objectively bad School Days anime, but that ending
  just packed such a punch that I adore it.. I had so much fun with that ending... XD. Another aspect is that if I don't
  "click" with a show that's well received, that really influences my viewpoint of a work, (like <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://rockmandash12.kinja.com/rockmandash-rambles-fate-zero-revisited-1637549445",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://rockmandash12.kinja.com/rockmandash-rambles-fate-zero-revisited-1637549445" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Fate/Zero</em></a></span>) thus I'm not really the best person to do reviews on highly
  acclaimed, popular series. This can lead to really disastrous results, but that hasn't really happened so far because
  unlike most reviewers I've seen, I'm odd in the fact that I tend to take into account other people's opinions, as can
  seen in the polarization number, and how I write some of my reviews.</p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">I like shows with big ideas, and strong themes, with the respective execution: I
  really appreciate it when works scream out their ideals, when they emphasize their themes out so everyone notices
  them. I like it when they are hammered down, and I like it when they get in so much that you really feel it. This has
  really shown its influence with the fate series, which I really love because of the ideals they have shown in the
  work.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">I like meta humor, and tropes quite a bit. I'm not as much of a TV troper as

  yeah, it's pretty lame, but I find that it's nice to have your own little thing that you can self identify with so

</h3><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">By being able to see one's biases, it enables you to better understand the
  perspective of the reviewer, and why they would say stuff in that way. I personally believe that everyone who does
  reviewing should make an article like this that shows all their biases, so people can better gauge your thoughts on
  said articles. Overall, mine can really be summed up with a focus on the influence of said experience, and I hope you
  learned something about me as you read through this. :)</p>
