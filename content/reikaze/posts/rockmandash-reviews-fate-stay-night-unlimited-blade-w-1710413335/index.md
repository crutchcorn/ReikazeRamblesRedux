While most of you are probably watching *Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works*, did you know that in 2010, *Unlimited Blade Works* got a movie under Studio Deen? It was also one of the first Reviews Iâ€™ve done on the Kinjaverse (before AniTAY was a thing), so I might as well share it, because Unlimited Blade Works (2014) is about to end. FYI it has been edited a bit since the original version, so keep that in mind.
