Thanks to [reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/visualnovels/comments/2vavxm/i_found_an_orchestra_that_mainly_plays_songs_from/) for sharing this awesomeness that is Autumn Leaf Orchestra, so I can pass the awesomeness to you! Autumn Leaf Orchestra is a group that does **VISUAL NOVEL ORCHESTRA RENDITIONS!!!!!** I have linked here A *Muv-Luv* Melody because I know you all love *Muv-Luv*, but they've done a ton of stuff, from [*ef*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-NVLRQfecA), to [*Clannad*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-236Eq0Ikz8), to [*White Album 2*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage\&v=gy_qJV7a9Ds). If you need me, I'm just going to be happy listening to these orchestrated mixes. While there are some parts I have issues with, I'm just glad to see that something like this exists, and some are just great ^.^
