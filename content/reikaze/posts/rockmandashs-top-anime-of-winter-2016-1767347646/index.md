<div><img alt src="./pshwnzherp2bg9pudl9g.png"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">It’s that time of year again, where we finish up another season and the reviews
  keep on pouring out. We’ve got a good season this time around, and like usual, I’m gonna tell you what I think are the
  best! Welcome to RockmanDash’s Top 5 Anime of Winter 2016.<br/></p>

  on the Season Overall</h4>
<img alt src="./m97ftmpsnlnbzedr7npi.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">From my time spent watching anime, I’ve always found the winter anime to be my
  favorite. While it didn’t have the big titles like the fall season and for the most part the shows are just average or
  below average, it’s a season that has been consistently top loaded with the best shows of the year like<em>
    NagiAsu</em>. This structure of winter seasons, while not is one everyone likes because the overall quality is
  pretty low and there aren’t that many shows, it’s one that keeps me engaged and entertained, and it has the shows that
  truly gets me to appreciate the media. This season is no exception to all of these and I’d argue it’s even an stronger
  example of this than most: the top here are of higher average quality than most top shows in my experience of watching
  seasonally. While many people have overlooked this season, I’ve been very much engaged, and I have to say, this is one
  of my favorite seasons in a while.<br/></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Why? The biggest reason has to be the acts of
  two studios stepping up their game: A-1 Studios and Studio Deen. A-1 Studios, as a studio that has little permanent
  staff, instead relying on freelancers has it’s ups in downs with this season happening to be up, but Deen, who has
  been consistently terrible, doing a bad job with works like <em>Log Horizon 2</em> and<em> Fate/Stay Night 2006</em>
  have really pulled a once and lifetime miracle. Want to know why? Read on!</p>

<hr class="gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw"/><h4 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h110077"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>Rules
</h4>
<img alt src="./tdpzgnljfxu50jkfwpin.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">My rules of this list are simple: if it aired/released this season, it can go on
  this list. I don’t see the point in only giving a show one chance during it’s airing season, and this is my list so
  I’ll list my favorite shows regardless of what season it started on. If this means that one show hogs the top spot for
  2 seasons, than good for that show! If it’s an OVA or m ovie that came out during the duration of the season I fell in
  love with, then it may be there. Also, I think that the seasonal split is arbitrary and unnecessary, so it’s
  completely gone here. Sorry about that, but that’s how I’m doing it. Also, different from this season is the number
  cap: I kept myself to 5 every time, but I’m dropping that now, allowing for more shows in a good season and less in a
  bad. That also means HMs for the most part should be gone, unless there’s a show that’s bad that I was hoping to be
  good or something. I also changed the formatting of it, so it may look quite different from the previous top
  lists.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Just an FYI, the placement of the show in the list is mostly based on my
  experience and enjoyment of the work, so if you’re wondering why something isn’t where you think it should be or you
  can’t really tell via the justification, that’s probably why. Also, just because a show is lower on the list doesn’t
  mean it’s bad - all of these are great, and a lower placement isn’t a mark against the show, at this point it’s nearly
  all personal preference.<br/></p>

  season, the one that everyone watched and talked about. While it was definitely good enough to warrant the hype and
  discussion of the show, it’s poor handling of mystery, it’s rushed second half of the show and contrived BS at times
  knock it down a notch in comparison to the best of the season. It’s absolutely a solid show with care to visual
  directing that we haven’t seen in TV anime in ages, it has great characters that get you invested in the dilemmas that
  they go through and it’s very compelling and engaging, enough to warrant the hype and adoration everyone had for it.
  While it’s a good show, it only barely makes it into my list of the top anime of the season, If only it wasn’t let
  down by a disappointing second half. </p>

  heart, a tragic tale of loss focused on kids that were ripped out of their world, forced to confront the struggle of
  kill or be killed itself. It’s a show that takes its scenario to heart, with actions that deal with realistic
  consequences which makes the show all that much more relatable and interesting, IMO. While it’s a show that has a
  rather slow pace that prevents you from really being completely engaged, the show really connects you to the cast
  well, being the most personal show in a while in my opinion – the show really allows you to get into the heads of the
  characters and care about the issues they deal with and the losses they have to endure through, if you really get into
  the show (It has one of the most interesting character deaths in recent times for an example). While it’s not for
  everyone, this is a show has an intimate style that I really appreciate (thanks VNs) and it’s a work that I fell in
  love with. It may be the show that finally gets me to read LNs, and I appreciate it for that. </p>

  of the season, Shirayukihime was a show that never disappointed me as it was a nice romance with an incredibly sweet
  relationship. The show is a show that is almost solely focused on the cast, and it does its characters exceedingly
  well, with the interactions between them consistently putting a smile on your face. The main appeal of the show to
  many, the romance between our two leads in this show is as great as it ever has been, one of the most enjoyable
  romances out there as they consistently improve each other while having moments where you can only describe as cute
  and adorable, seeing them was great. The rest of the cast isn’t a slouch either as well, being equally enjoyable and
  making every moment fun to watch. While it wasn’t action packed or anything, it never ceased to put a smile on my face
  and that’s worth the recommendation in my book.</p>

  first impression, when you look into this world, you’ll quickly realize that it’s absolutely hilarious and insane, and
  add to this insane world an equally insane cast and you got humor that is some of the best around and that really hold
  the show throughout. Every time I watched it, I knew I was going to have a good time and this show never disappointed,
  always making me laugh while putting a big stupid grin on my face. It’s great to see Studio Deen do so well after all
  of the consistent failure they’ve seen, and I can’t wait for season 2. :)</p>

  care? Not really, as these are some of the best of anime and I love them too much to care. I know a lot of people
  don’t really care about sports anime, but as of late they’ve quickly become one of my favorite anime genres due to
  their consistently amazing execution, with the positives of Shounen shows without many of the negatives. The ones
  airing this season are really great, and have been some of the shows I’ve enjoyed the most as this season progressed.
  <em>Ace of Diamonds</em>, while slowly progressing through its games this season was consistently exciting while <em>Haikyuu!!</em>
  (or how AniTAY members like to call it, <em>Hypekyuu!!) </em>showed us awesome matches and got the viewer constantly
  hyped.

  <em>Rakugo </em>is, where do you even start? It’s a fantastic show that (in my opinion) easily earns its place as best
  show of the season and is an early contender for anime of the year: It’s a show that tells an interesting historical
  story on the decline of the art form of rakugo and the tale of our interesting characters that are fleshed out and
  feel real. While the plot of <em>Rakugo</em> may sound boring because it’s literally about telling stories, it is the
  execution, how it tells the story that makes this great, being able to handle all of its elements extremely well. The
  show has fantastic pacing, solid visuals, a great score, amazing characters and the best part: it’s consistently
  engaging with every episode being better than the last. It’s definitely a must watch, my favorite of the season and
  one of my favorite anime ever. It’s a timepiece that displays a story of the past extremely well, and a shining
  example of what shows like this should be like. I never thought I’d say this, but well played Studio Deen, can’t wait
  for more.</p>
