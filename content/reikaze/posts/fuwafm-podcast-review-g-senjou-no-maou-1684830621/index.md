Remember that time when I shared that podcast about [*Ever 17* where I used a really snarky transition from title to text](https://rockmandash12.kinja.com/tired-of-me-talking-about-vns-1676654868)? Sorry, no such transition here, but I do have a podcast to share! This is the FuwaFM Podcast review of [*G-Senjou no Maou*](http://tay.kotaku.com/g-senjou-no-maou-the-tay-review-1524540625), so if you didn't get enough of me talking/not talking in the [AniTAY Podcast](http://anitay.kinja.com/ani-tay-podcast-episode-10-from-ani-tay-with-love-1684583335), or rambling about visual novels in written form, now you get to hear me rambling about it in spoken word! ***\*Note: This may or may not include heavy spoilers, so proceed with caution.***
