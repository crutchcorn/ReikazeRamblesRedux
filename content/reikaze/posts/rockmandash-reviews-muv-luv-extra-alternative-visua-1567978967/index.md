<div><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> Welcome to Rockmandash Reviews, and this is my review of the highly regarded
  <em>Muv-Luv</em> Visual Novels made by Age.<em> Muv-Luv</em> is a series that defies expectations, manipulates your
  emotions, and justifies it’s place at the top of VNDB as these games are some of the best in the genre. </p>

<img alt src="./s40vq1fern1w15s5myxf.png"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Even though there are 2 Visual Novels in the series: <em>Muv-Luv</em> and<em> Muv
  Luv Alternative,</em> there are 3 Arcs of this series that are very different from each other but are all very
  integral to the plot. The 3 Arcs are Extra, Unlimited, and Alternative, and I’m going to talk about them one at at a
  time, for the sake of convenience. </p>
<h3 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h120170"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>Extra</h3>
<img alt src="./oqrfsprr74mgj7hihkyx.png"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><em> Muv Luv Extra</em> is the first Arc of the game, and it’s your traditional
  dating sim. On your first playthrough, there’s very little worth not here, nothing here but a slice of life romantic
  comedy. Extra doesn’t do anything remarkably special, it’s a silly and forgettable Visual Novel that is what one might
  expect from the genre on a surface level, but it’s not horrible in what it does. </p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">For
  those of you who aren’t a fan of the genre, and aren’t particularly used to it, you might get bored of it and it might
  be a pain to read. When I first played through the game, I eventually got bored if the antics and skipped most of the
  second half. Even given that I did do that, I felt like I didn’t really miss much. The one redeemable factor in <em>Extra</em>
  is that it develops the characters very well: Extra does a lot of foreshadowing, gets you engaged with the cast and
  builds chemistry, so it’s definitely essential to experience. These elements make a repeat playthrough of
  <em>Extra </em>very much worthwhile after you’ve played through the main trilogy, but on your first playthrough it
  might be rough.</p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">The game really engages you with the world that surrounds Takeru: get to know how
  his close friends and accentuates act, and you get used to this nice, peaceful world that is in Muv Luv....<br/></p><h3 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h120171"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>Unlimited </h3>
<img alt src="./c9td9wjp1yjdoyawynvp.png"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">...Until<em> Muv-Luv Unlimited</em> rips the main character Takeru out of this nice
  and peaceful life, and throws him into a universe of despair. <em>Unlimited </em>takes place an alternate world where
  aliens known as BETA invade the world, pushing humanity to the brink of extinction, leaving large parts of Eurasia
  uninhabitable. In <em>Muv-Luv Unlimited</em>, Takeru has to get used to the life of a military cadet, with the treat
  of death looming upon him… and you are in for the ride.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> Unfortunately, <em>Muv-Luv
  Unlimited </em>has one huge flaw that keeps it from being something spectacular… Unlimited does a weird balancing act
  between the slice of life of <em>Extra</em> and the seriousness that is<em> Alternative </em>and ends up too
  lighthearted to it’s determent. In every aspect of <em>Muv-Luv Unlimited</em>, everything is a bit too lighthearted:
  from the atmosphere, to the pacing, to the writing in general. There is absolutely no sense of urgency, which is
  ultimately frustrating, but the arc squanders those ideas thanks to this imbalance. The atmosphere and tone of a game
  is very important, and <em>Unlimited </em>is an example of what goes wrong when you don’t pay attention to them.
  Ultimately, it’s done in this fashion to make alternative better, being a key part of the coming of age for Takeru,
  but as an arc itself, it doesn’t live up to it’s potential.</p>
<h3 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h120172"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>Alternative</h3>
<img alt src="./711978557808876072.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> If <em>Unlimited </em>was wasted potential though, Alternative is that potential
  unleashed into the world and made into something amazing. Alternative picks up right from the end of
  <em>Unlimited</em>, where Takeru fails to save everyone and everything he knows is blown to smithereens thanks to
  Alternative V. Instead of Takeru dying however, he comes back to where he was… at the very beginning of
  <em>Unlimited</em>. This time, Takeru has experience of events, and he tries to change the events so the world isn’t
  screwed over. At the beginning, it’s a game of spot the difference… but when the <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButterflyOfDoom",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButterflyOfDoom" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">butterfly effect</a></span>
  kicks in, it kicks in hard... </p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Everything changes. The game makes you feel like an
  outsider of this world, taking that feeling and running with it. It creates a bond between you and the main character,
  the only person who’s been on this insane trip with you, and the only person you can relate to in this alternate
  universe.</p>

<img alt src="./z3kpgjvz8iyx5nx7nan4.jpg"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><em>Alternative </em>emphasizes it’s unique and different world... and how they
built up this world is absolutely fantastic. It’s filled with engaging politics of the world, exposes on the military
environment in a remarkably engrossing manner,shows fascinating people with all sorts of problems, and makes you
immersed in the society that differs so much from what we’re used to. The best part about this interesting world is
that they go so in depth about it, and any world building you would ever want is here... its absolutely fantastic and
I wish that more works would build works this comprehensive. </p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Plot wise, <em>Muv-Luv Alternative </em>is a military invasion story similar to the
  popular<em> Attack on Titan</em> but with good pacing and character development. While<em> Attack on Titan </em>focuses
  on objectives and the deaths of your favorite characters, <em>Muv-Luv </em>focuses on everything you can think of and
  builds them in an engaging manner. You get to experience tactics, strategies, ideals, characters, pacing, trauma, even
  a bit of pseudoscience! It’s pretty much everything I would ever want out of this type of story, and it does it
  extremely well.</p>
<img alt src="./lhsx6eh3e7fvsovungdi.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><em> Alternative </em>impressed me because it integrated everything in the previous
  plots, making everything even mentioned important and relevant in some way shape or form, and never leaving red
  hearings. One thing that’s surprised me about alternative is even though it has a slow pace, I really did enjoy the
  pacing. I believe it’s because<em> Alternative</em> spent every bit of its time explaining the world, doing some of
  the best character development I’ve ever seen, and the most important part: keeping me completely engaged in the plot.
</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> The writing in this game is absolutely phenomenal, manipulating the player in ways
  they have not been manipulated before. If <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","Internal link","http://tay.kotaku.com/g-senjou-no-maou-the-tay-review-1524540625",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://tay.kotaku.com/g-senjou-no-maou-the-tay-review-1524540625"><em>G-Senjou no Maou</em></a></span>
  is a roller coaster of a plot, then<em> Muv-Luv </em>is a road trip; beautifully showing you the world at the pace you
  want to go, getting you absorbed, and getting you attached to the plot. I wouldn’t say alternative is the best story
  ever; it’s not in my opinion. It is however, one of the best stories I’ve ever experienced. It’s does everything you
  would want in this setting, and does it very well.</p>
<h3 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h120173"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>Overall </h3><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> It’s hard to sum up<em> Muv-Luv </em>as a whole, because there’s so much variance between
  the arcs. That being said: <em>Muv Luv</em> has some of the highest highs in the medium, with <em>Alternative</em>
  being 20+ hours of highs. Even though there are lows in the form of <em>Extra</em> for some, the better arcs
  absolutely overshadow the negative arcs, especially because of how well Alternative uses every element of your
  experience and integrates it into the story.<em> Muv-Luv Alternitive</em> is one of the best experiences you’ll ever
  find in this medium, but if you want to play Alternative, you will have to go through quite a bit lows to get to the
  better parts of the series.</p>

<img alt src="./vz3lznnkicy1ulskzedu.png"/>
<img alt src="./lfxpinmfwkxiqya5nek7.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">The cast is the highlght of the series. You follow the main character, Takeru
  Shirogane. At first Takeru is your typical high school student with a carefree and kinda mean attitude, but as you go
  through the game, you see him develop into a meaningful character, one who understands others, and becomes a mature
  person. He does an excellent job as a representative of the player, as he’s the only character you can relate to. He’s
  a great main character, and he’s probably the character I’ve been most attached to in any medium <strong>ever</strong>.
</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Because <em>Muv-Luv</em> starts out as a dating sim, there are plenty of heroines, but
  moreso than the strengths as individuals, it’s remarkable how the player gets attached to them as a whole. Even with a
  large cast, all the characters are written absolutely fantastically and they all have a reason for being there. They
  are all extremely fleshed out with interesting back stories, interesting personalities, etc. Because of your situation
  in <em>Unlimited </em>and <em>Alternative</em>, the game really creates a feeling like you are in a squad, and it’s
  icing on the cake. All the characters are written well, and they make the world feel real, and they are the best part
  of the series.</p>

<img alt src="./xyvfvrnqibduhegdbgaz.png"/>
<img alt src="./s3ugp2m70deowgbl9t32.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><em>Muv-Luv</em> has a bad habit of starting fairly weak, but getting better the
  further you go along. The presentation are no different than the story in this regard: they both start pretty average
  at the beginning, but they get better as you progress. At the beginning, the visuals have a 4:3 aspect ratio*, and
  average but entertaining art, but the big problem with visuals in the beginning is they didn’t have enough art in
  general. With the sound, It’s mostly average, with little to stand out. <em>Extra</em> has nothing but generic and
  silly songs, and while Unlimited steps this up a notch with some fantastic songs, tbut the utilizationl and<!-- -->
  makes Unlimited feel like wasted potential. Even with the knocks on <em>Muv-Luv Extra</em> and <em>Unlimited</em>, the
  presentation of these games do their job and they get out of the way for the characters and the world.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">*for the Original Fan TL’d version at least that this originally reviewed, but the
  localized version is in 16:9 like you’d expect</p>

<img alt src="./b4abbp6eg7lxj0wawr15.jpg"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> Alternative does a little bit better in this aspect and when you launch it up,
be prepared for a slight quality jump. The big difference though, is that Alternative has some niceties like 16:9\* and
some of the best <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbdVfJGRbfw",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbdVfJGRbfw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">engrish</a></span>\*\* I have seen in a long time. As for the sound,
some of the tracks are absolutely fantastic, and the timing of these great tracks is something to be admired, but a
majority of the soundtrack is just average. Alternative’s presentation is nice because it takes care of all the small
details, just like in the plot. Also, All the FMV’s have this nice 80's charm to it, and I dig it.</p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">** The official localization gave them proper voice actors, so this only applies for
  the FanTL</p>
<div class="ooo3c9-0 PpIMM align--bleed has-video media-large video-embed embed-frame"><span class="flex-video widescreen"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yAXEMvIHtT0" width="560"></iframe><span class="js_recommend" data-chomp-id="yAXEMvIHtT0" data-recommend-id="youtube://yAXEMvIHtT0" data-recommended="false" id="youtube-yAXEMvIHtT0"></span></span></div><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> The character art, UI, voice acting and aesthetics in general are pretty much the same
  throughout the games. In general, art is just average and there’s no getting around that, but it has it’s charms and
  it can grow on you like it has done for many. The visuals never actively hinders the experience, but it’s rarely top
  of the class. The voice actors are the same in all games and they do a pretty nice job in all of them.</p>

<img alt src="./gp4teohnljwo2kgs0xm7.png"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Normally, I’d just write a few paragraphs about my personal enjoyment of the
game, but Muv-Luv is an experience unlike anything else, and as a result it deeply resonated to me, to the point in
which keeping my thoughts contained here would do it a bit of injustice. I whole <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://rockmandash12.kinja.com/rockmandash-rambles-why-i-loved-muv-luv-but-you-might-1566859006",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://rockmandash12.kinja.com/rockmandash-rambles-why-i-loved-muv-luv-but-you-might-1566859006" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">opinion piece on my experience with Muv-Luv</a></span> but if that’s too
long for you, I’ll say it here: It’s phenomenal and I love it. <br/></p>

<img alt src="./711978613740308264.png"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><em>2020 Edit Note</em>: I have a few thoughts here from when I wrote this article back in
2014 before the official localization, and I’m keeping them here for posterity’s sake, but know that it doesn’t apply
to the current game if you pick it up on steam. </p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><code>There are a few little things I want to say before I get into my personal
  thoughts on Muv-Luv, so i’ll say them here. Muv-Luv made me realize how dependent I am on fan translations, as there
  were parts that weren’t translated because of the engine, and I felt completely lost. This game hates windows 8 and
  likes to crash at specific parts in the end of extra and weird stuff like not displaying subtitles on videos. If you
  have a windows 7 computer, try to play it on that, but if you don’t, you’ll have to do what I had to do to continue
  playing, which was downloading a save online to get to Unlimited. Also, the</code><span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbdVfJGRbfw",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbdVfJGRbfw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>engrish</code></a></span><code>
  was absolutely “fantastic”, it was one of my favorite parts of Alternative. It really helps add a bit more
  lightheartedness to a pretty bleak story, and it was very enjoyable.</code></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><code>One
  thing that might hinder your experience, is the obligatory Eroge warning here: <strong>THIS GAME HAS SEXUAL
    CONTENT***. IT’S AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE PLOT AND KINDA APPEARS EVERYWHERE. IF YOU ARE NOT A FAN, AVOID THIS
    GAME.</strong></code></p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">*** this applies for the FanTL and if you get the 18+ patch for the localized
  version, but the localization actually does a great job in avoiding these once thought to be essential elements of the
  story.</p>

<img alt src="./vcshgha5alqretey7qvi.png"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> I love <em>Muv-Luv</em>. It has it’s ups and downs, but it’s a prime example of
why Visual Novels is one of the best ways of storytelling, with some of the highest highs that I’ve ever experienced.
There’s an INCREDIBLY HIGH barrier of entry, but if you can get through them <em>Extra</em> and<em> Unlimited</em>,
you’ll have one of the best experiences of storytelling that any medium has to offer. </p>
