  gaming, it can be rather intimidating in comparison to consoles as it’s more technical than and has a higher upfront
  cost. As we get further in this generation though, PCs are proving to be a great option for gaming with better
  performance, indie games, and a massive backlog. Need some help jumping into the world of PC gaming? Welcome to the
  Talk Amongst Yourselves’ Beginner Guide to Gaming PC Hardware.<br/></p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">While consoles have their advantages like having a better TV experience, ease of

  plenty of benefits as well, many of them being so strong that PC quickly becomes a favorite for many. From the better
  visual fidelity that you hear PC gamers brag about all the time to the massive backlog of PC games that are all
  available to play on your modern system, There’s a lot here all of this adds up to make PC a great platform for games
  and one that is worth considering. I mean, where else do you have a gaming machine that can be used for non-gaming
  activities, constant sales on games, near endless amounts of backwards compatibility, easy upgrades, etc… the PC is
  truly a great platform worth considering.</p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">When learning about anything, there’s always a new set of terminology to learn.
  Before we jump in, here’s a quick list of common terminology in regards to PC hardware. My definitions are rather
  simplistic and are in regards to gaming, so if you want to find a more in depth definition or need more definitions,
  you can always do so. For an example, here’s lifehacker’s, but not in terms of gaming: </p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>CPU (Central Processing Unit) -</strong> The “brains” of your computer, what
  runs the programs you are using. In games, a CPU runs all the logic and physics behind it. This affects the speed of
  your everyday tasks, as well as in games.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)
  - </strong>like a cpu, it’s what runs the things you do, but it is optimized for graphics: it takes the information
  regarding to visuals and puts it it on the screen. This is the most important for a gaming build as it’s essentially
  what enables your game to run at the settings you you want.</p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Cooler - </strong>CPUs and GPUs get hot, so you need a cooler that takes the
  heat from the chip and puts it into the room. The better cooler you get, the cooler your parts will run.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Overclocking - </strong>Overclocking, or OC’ing is taking the chips past the
  manufacturer’s recommended spec to get better performance. You may need specific parts depending on if you do this.
</p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Motherboard -</strong> The motherboard is what connects everything together
  and allows it to run.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>RAM (Random Access Memory) - </strong>This is really
  fast temporary storage, and will make a big deal when gaming if you don’t have enough or are multitasking. </p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>HDD (Hard Disk Drive) - </strong>This is what you put all your files on, and
  it uses moving disks to store it.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>SSD (Solid State Drive) - </strong>This is
  like an HDD but instead of a moving disks, it uses chips. This is much faster, but more expensive.</p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>PSU (Power Supply Unit) - </strong>This is what takes the electricity from
  your wall and allows your computer to use it. </p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>FPS (Frames per Second)
  - </strong>this is a measurement of how fast your game is running.</p>

  Busting</h3>
<img alt src="./p5zhssekusj1qgbu6wpp.png"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Like everything platform for gaming, PC gaming has its fair share of myths and
  misinformation, so before we start this off, doing some myth busting would be helpful, and that’s exactly what we’re
  going to do here. </p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>GAMING PC MYTH #1</strong> - Gaming PC’s are really
  expensive.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">This can be true depending on what type of PC you’re going to build, but
  in general it’s not that much more expensive than a normal computer and you can get a great PC at the prices the
  consoles are going for. The expensive aspect of it is also mainly in upfront costs, once you get a pc games are cheap,
  there aren’t any subscription plans you need to pay, and you don’t really need to spend money on upgrades as that is
  up on you. You don’t need a $2,000 PC to get a good experience, as even a $400 PC will give you great value and
  performance. <br/><br/><strong>GAMING PC MYTH #2</strong> - Gaming PC’s are hard to build.<br/>While computers can be
  frustrating at times, the actual act is rather easy: it’s like putting Lego’s together, everything has a specific
  place and fits in seamlessly. If you find that aspect frustrating still, there are plenty of guides out there. If I
  had to say where the complicated aspects come in, I would say that it’s in troubleshooting issues, not the process
  itself. <br/><br/><strong>GAMING PC MYTH #3</strong> - The CPU is the most important part of a gaming pc, so I’m going
  to get an i7.<br/>In many prebuilds, they privilege the CPU, which is exactly why they are a horrible buy for the most
  part as GPU’s are more important in Gaming PCs and are what makes them run games well. You don’t need anything more
  than an i5 in gaming, anything more will not give you tangible boosts in gaming, while spending more on a GPU will.
  Spending money on a CPU is more helpful if you have other means like video editing or you multitask a lot.</p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>GAMING PC MYTH #4: </strong>Is a liquid cooled PC better/superior?</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">While a custom liquid cooler may be rather impressive, this is not necessarily the case, as
  you can get a tower air cooler (Cooler Master Hyper 212, Noctua NH14) that can beat closed loop water cooling kits
  while being cheaper, or you could put that money into better components.</p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>GAMING PC MYTH #5: </strong>-Insert Brand Here- sucks so I’ll buy -Insert
  other brand here-. </p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">PC makers are generally in parity, so this usually doesn’t apply,
  try not to buy via brands. While ATM I wouldn’t recommend AMD CPUs for an example, that does not mean the company as a
  whole sucks or that they have never made anything good. On the GPU side, they’re pretty much neck to neck in
  performance, trading blows at nearly every price range, so don’t let brand dictate what you buy, get what suits your
  situation the best.</p>

  would take a long time and there are many guides out there on how to do it. Putting a PC is like putting legos
  together so you shouldn’t have too much trouble if you’re following a guide. Here is my favorite guide for building a
  PC, made by newegg in video form, while lifehacker has a great one if you’d rather not watch a video. If you don’t
  like these, there are plenty of other guides out there, and it’s really just a quick search away.</p>

<hr class="gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw"/><h3 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h108046"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>Q&amp;A
</h3>
<img alt src="./r1pncwsolmwznnjnqjae.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Prebuilds vs DIY?</strong><br/>DIY is obviously cheaper, but if you’re such a
  technophobe, a prebuild is a good option. Prebuilds usually have tragic flaws that lead to many recommending against
  them like cheap cases, poor airflow, poor power supplies, limited upgradability, and proprietary parts, so you should
  avoid them in general but if you have to they aren’t the worst option out there. I’d recommend NCIX if you are going
  prebuild, but i’d recommend DIY over any prebuild because when you pick the parts, you know what’s going into your pc.<br/><br/><strong>What’s
    Overclocking, and how do I do it?</strong><br/>Overclocking is changing the speed of your parts so that they run
  faster, to get more performance out of your money. Certain parts are built with overclocking in mind. Overclocking is
  faster but they also run hotter, so you might want a better cooler. If you have an intel build, you need a specific
  motherboard, and a processor with a K at the end.<br/><br/>What are some Upgrades you would recommend if you don’t want
  to do a completely new build?</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><br/>for general purpose use, I’d recommend an SSD.
  Blazing fast, and they are getting cheaper by the day! If you don’t have a GPU, but have a computer built in the past
  few years, and you don’t want to build a new rig I’d get an Nvidia GTX 750 Ti, a GTX 950 75w or AMD RX 460 because
  those are very low power and don’t require your power supply to have extra power while giving you pretty solid gaming
  performance.</p>

<hr class="gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw"/><h3 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h108047"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>The
  Builds</h3>
<img alt src="./dd5pg0oenzriwmkcy19g.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Now onto the fun part and the meat of this guide: Discussion about builds itself.
  With the actual build itself hardware, you can spend quite a bit, but you don’t really need to depending on your
  situation. To get the best bang for the buck, you’re going to have to buy used but we’re not going to cover that –
  that will be in the Budget PC gaming guide, but the recommendations here are where the best bang for buck is new. This
  means there’s no consistent aesthetic, and you may want to put some effort into making it look all nice, even if that
  means spending a bit more.<br/></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><br/>Also due to consistent sales, this isn’t
  necessarily specialized and should be used to get an idea of what you should be aiming for: if you want specifics, I’d
  recommend asking over on Reddit’s /r/buildapc or /r/cabalofthebuildsmiths. In this guide, we’re dealing with new
  parts, with a few price brackets – Console Challenger(400), Mainstream 1080p Machine + Budget VR (600), and The Point
  of Diminishing Returns (900). Each section will include a pcpartpicker link as well as a paragraph on the rig and
  recommended upgrades if you have more money than this but don’t want to step up to the next build.</p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Also, the price does not include software or accessories; those are later on in the
  guide. Keep in mind that prices do fluctuate, so if any build is significantly higher than it says so, just post it in
  the comments and I’ll try to fix it.<br/><br/><strong>KEEP IN MIND, BEFORE PICKING A BUILD, CHECK THE RESOLUTION OF YOUR
    MONITOR, OR THE ONE YOU ARE GOING TO UPGRADE TO.</strong> Gaming is all about the GPU. If you have a lower
  resolution monitor, there is very little reason to get a more expensive rig, as certain GPUs will run everything fine
  at certain resolutions and spending more provides little noticeable benefit. My 7970 I got a few years ago for an
  example has been rocking 1080p in nearly any game I throw at it. I only upgraded to the R9 fury in my current rig
  because I got a 4k TV to use as a monitor and I’ve been pushing my poor 7970 to it’s limit with those higher
  resolutions.<br/><br/>That being said, the great part about PCs is the wide variety of choices. If you’d rather spend
  more on a case, or get a different GPU, then do so. You can pick and choose and this is just a guide, my personal
  recommendation for what you should get. The law of diminishing returns will affect you if you buy high end, so it
  might be better if you just buy mid-range stuff. The recommended upgrades are if you want a better experience in that
  price bracket. if you want more performance, step up a bracket. <strong>Also, as of (9/13/16), Don’t buy an AMD CPU,
    and get a new GPU now. </strong>They’ve been due for an upgrade for a while<strong> (</strong>AMD hasn’t upgraded
  their CPUs in several years), and Zen’s looking promising so you’d be a fool to upgrade now unless you really need to.
  GPU wise though, GO GO GO! The new GPUs have been big upgrades that provided significantly more price to performance.
</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><br/>A note for international members, all prices are in USD and prices of specific
  parts may vary depending on your location. Sorry. <br/></p>

  price? Now that the prices have gone reasonable, we can get a great gaming PC for the same price as consoles, and it
  can do so much more. This PC is already a better machine than consoles as it can game comfortably at 1080p and is
  really a solid option for anyone in the market. Also, I really don’t recommend going lower than this because if you go
  lower, especially with the GPU, you’ll run into price to performance issues. I guess you could probably Pentium G3258
  and overclock that sucker to match performance with the i3, but that’s going to run hotter, has an older architecture,
  and doesn’t have hyperthreading. Overall though, this is a great little rig that is a great bang for the buck while
  performing better than consoles. Both GPUs give out essentially console quality performance, and are both rather power
  efficient chips. (depending on the 950 you get, it may need a 6 pin power connector).<br/></p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Worth mentioning however, is that you can technically do better performance wise at
  this price range, and that may matter quite a lot given that we’re under the sweet spot for gaming, and the i3 can
  bottleneck GPUs in certain tasks. The issue though is it’s not a really recommendable path, and this task can
  bottleneck in others (it’s all about tradeoffs): an AMD FX processor. If you only care about performance, everything
  else be damned, the FX CPUs by AMD are a better option... but I don’t recommend those given their age, lower IPC and
  how much heat they generate, but they run faster in games, beating out the i3 in most tests. Funny how a chip can go
  from an i5 competitor to being compared to a lower tier chip.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Recommended
  upgrades:</strong> For the money these CPUs will be great, but you may want to consider going up to a quad core Intel
  chip, they have significant advantages in comparison to these. Also, there’s a few things I skimped out to hit 400
  though: the PSU is pretty low wattage, and I threw in the cheapest HDD I can find. You can live with these, but you
  may not want to. I’d recommend going SSD and getting a better HDD. </p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">If you get the FX chip and have extra cash, get a cooler like the Cryorig H7, get a
  better PSU and try to OC it for even more performance.</p>

Get an i5 and you’re basically ready for anything gaming has to throw at you
  CPU wise. This upgrade makes the rig significantly more futureproof while performing better in many titles. More
  exiting though... is the GPU as it’s <strong>NEW GPU TIME! </strong>Thanks to the introduction of cards like the
  Radeon Rx 480 and 1060, we now have have VR capable GPUs down to affordable prices. You’ll be ready for the Vive and
  the Rift if you want them, and these guys can handle everything you throw at it 1080p. They’re also a good buy
  considering they’re about 970-980 performance, the higher end chips that devs are now targeting due to their
  popularity. Add in the fact that they’re similar to the PS4 Pro and Scorpio in performance and you should be set for a
  while.<br/></p>
<div class="ooo3c9-0 PpIMM align--bleed has-video media-large video-embed embed-frame"><span class="flex-video widescreen"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2R76wLCxRXY" width="560"></iframe><span class="js_recommend" data-chomp-id="2R76wLCxRXY" data-recommend-id="youtube://2R76wLCxRXY" data-recommended="false" id="youtube-2R76wLCxRXY"></span></span></div><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> So,that leads the question: 1060 or 470/480? 3,4,6,8Gb ram? with so many variables, it
  ultimately comes up to what you care about more: performance now or performance later. In most benchmarks, the 1060 is
  up by 10% in almost all games, but it’s also usually more expensive. The exception is in the new DX12 games which
  utilize AMD’s design better, so the RX chips will go faster there. The AMD cards also have more memory at a lower
  price, setting them up to age well, just like all of AMD’s GCN cards (7xxx, 2xx, 3xx). </p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> You need to ask yourself if you care about performance now vs later, how long you
  plan on keeping your GPU and what company you prefer to make the decision between 1060 vs 480. About VRAM, and the cut
  down cards: I recommend the cheaper, smaller memory versions as these cards are for the most part underpowered for
  higher resolutions thanks to more demanding games (though, upscaling tricks like on the PS4 Pro may change that). In
  my mind, if you needed the extra memory you might as well go for a more expensive card, and The lesser memory cards
  are better bang for your buck. While the internet screams doom and gloom about the 3gb 1060 being nerfed, it’s
  ultimately an amazing 1080p card, and the 470/480 still has 4gb at the lower price so you’ll be set for a while. (If
  you can get a 4gb 480, get it, they’re like unicorns)</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Recommended Upgrades
  - </strong>I left out an SSD: this won’t influence your gaming performance but you’ll see a hit in daily use. Get one,
  it’s a really nice device to have. If you would rather “futureproof” yourself a bit more and/or have ~$300 to spend on
  your GPU, go with the 8gb 480 or 6gb 1060, or an older GPU like the R9 Fury (which I personally have). The Fury’s a
  nifty card which has a lot of compute power for the ~$275-$300 that it’s going for, even coming in spitting range of
  the 1070 in higher resolutions, but takes more power and has 4gb of ram (though, HBM which complicates things).</p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">There’s a concept called diminishing returns, and this rig is where it is because of
  that: the more you spend, the less gains you’ll get. This rig is basically the last point where your rig is still
  competitive in bang for buck charts as it performs very well in gaming, with one of the finest GPUs this generation
  has to offer, the Nvidia GTX 1070. This is the upper end of the sweet spot, a killer rig that’ll handle almost
  everything you throw at it. Worth noting, unlike the other rigs, this one doesn’t have an AMD equivalent, you’ll have
  to wait for Vega for that.<br/><br/>Also worth noting, is that we hit the peak for bang for buck with the last rig, and
  a lot of the changes have been not necessary performance wise, but are affordable upgrades that make a difference in
  your usage of it. It’s base is the same as the last rig (Same motherboard, same CPU, same RAM, same case), but it
  makes key upgrades that most PC enthusiasts would say are a must with a (slightly) better PSU, an SSD and a
  aftermarket heatsink, things you really should have if you’re spending almost 1k on a PC.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Recommended Upgrades -</strong> The case is still budget, the motherboard is
  budget, it has a cheap PSU, etc. Upgrade those to your liking.</p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">If you really want more performance and have the money, get a K processor.
  Overclocking will mean better performance in games, and a more “futureproofed rig” but it means an expensive
  motherboard and a more expensive processor. Going i7 won’t have much noticable performance in games as well, and more
  cores, while being nice for workstations, isn’t really all that useful for a gaming rig. If you want a stronger GPU,
  you’re going 1080 or Titan X (pascal), but those are luxuries, rather expensive cards that are made to perform at the
  unnecessarily high resolutions out there.</p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">While this is a hardware guide, this is a pc after all and you still need to install
  the basic software on it. After you put your rig together, you’ll need to install the OS, and for gaming, there aren’t
  too many options. These builds aren’t hackintoshes so Mac OSX is out, and Linux doesn’t have a lot of games so your
  best bet is Windows. Before you get your rig, I’d recommend downloading all of the drivers of your parts and using
  that as the drivers on the disc are outdated, but if your pc is connected to windows, the latest OS’s are very good at
  automatically downloading drivers. <br/></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><br/>Link to Windows - <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software…</a></span>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">The best controller for windows is the xbox 360 or xbox one controller as it’s the
  most compatible and the one that causes the least amount of hassle. Gamepad support isn’t perfect on PC though, so
  keep that in mind. Also, if you have a wireless xbox controller, you will need a pc wireless receiver. I recently got
  a Gamesir G3s which works exactly like an xbox on PC but is 30 bucks for wireless, so I’d recommend you give that a
  look.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Wired Xbox 360 Controller - <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga="[false]" href="https://smile.amazon.com/Microsoft-Wired-Controller-Windows-Console/dp/B004QRKWLA/ref=sr_1_2?ascsubtag=265476f4b594a3ac43fea39c29c83df7cfb907a2&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=wired xbox 360 controller&amp;qid=1473842631&amp;s=pc&amp;sr=1-2&amp;tag=kinja-20" target="_blank">$25</a></span><br/>Wireless 360 Controller - <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga="[false]" href="https://smile.amazon.com/Microsoft-Wireless-Controller-Windows-Console/dp/B004QRKWKQ/ref=sr_1_4?ascsubtag=907010ca5ced43c741f6b3c79e4042fed0b11ec6&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=wireless xbox 360 and adapter&amp;qid=1473842765&amp;s=pc&amp;sr=1-4&amp;tag=kinja-20" target="_blank">$35</a></span> + Wireless 360 Reciever - <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga="[false]" href="https://smile.amazon.com/Xbox-Microsoft-Authentic-Wireless-Packaging/dp/B00FAS1WDG/ref=sr_1_2?ascsubtag=9a110f49282171e760265430bff27a9c90285e0b&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=wireless xbox 360 and adapter&amp;qid=1473842795&amp;s=pc&amp;sr=1-2&amp;tag=kinja-20" target="_blank">$15</a></span><br/>Xbox One Controller w/ wire- <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga="[false]" href="https://smile.amazon.com/Microsoft-Xbox-Controller-Cable-Windows/dp/B00O65I2VY/ref=sr_1_8?ascsubtag=2e455a4e31bb8d795c6e03be92ef864318afd081&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=wireless xbox 360 controller for pc&amp;qid=1473842667&amp;s=pc&amp;sr=1-8&amp;tag=kinja-20" target="_blank">$45</a></span><br/>Xbox One Controller w/ Adapter - <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga="[false]" href="https://smile.amazon.com/Microsoft-Xbox-Controller-Wireless-Adapter-Windows/dp/B015IX3X3E/ref=sr_1_5?ascsubtag=4cde298cc0e9bcfa37375a2cafbeedd51d0736ad&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=wireless xbox 360 and adapter&amp;qid=1473842795&amp;s=pc&amp;sr=1-5&amp;tag=kinja-20" target="_blank">$60</a></span><br/>Gamesir G3s - <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga="[false]" href="https://smile.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Wireless-Controller-Smartphone-Playstation-3/dp/B019H5II8Y/ref=sr_1_cc_1?ascsubtag=39672f18d99d6fbced9a33e0ecccfd35656012a2&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=gamesir g3s&amp;qid=1473842878&amp;s=aps&amp;sr=1-1-catcorr&amp;tag=kinja-20" target="_blank">$30</a></span></p>
