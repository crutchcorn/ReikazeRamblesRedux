Because us over at FuwaFM have a podcast! 2, in fact! One of them is a Fate/stay night review which has both me and [Grex](https://kinja.com/grex) on board, and another about H-Scenes in VNs! (which nobody from AniTAY was in, but is worth looking into regardless. Fuwaâ€™s resident H-scene guy Ryechu was on it!)
