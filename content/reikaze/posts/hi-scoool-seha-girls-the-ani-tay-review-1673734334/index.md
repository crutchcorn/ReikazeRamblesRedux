<div><img alt src="./q1qhue3bzu0yevvf4hdd.png"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> Have you ever imagined SEGA consoles turned into cute girls doing silly things
  in a SEGA high school? No? How odd. Oh well. Even if you didn't, they've made a short anime of it, called <em>Hi☆sCoool!
    SeHa Girls</em> for your enjoyment... or not.</p>

<img alt src="./1058790216224462696.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Regardless of the quality of the show, I'm just so amused by the concept that I have
  to give it some credit. I mean, someone has to be either really bored, or really creative to make an anime about 3
  Sega Game Consoles (Mega Drive, Saturn &amp; Dreamcast) turning into high school girls, attending a SEGA High school
  where they have to go through SEGA related games/events to get medals to graduate. Seriously... who comes up with this
  stuff? It's great.</p><h4 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h116184"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>The
  Consoles/Girls</h4>
<img alt src="./wpigtckuy37knarjcv8d.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> The consoles/girls/things/whatever... make for surprisingly great characters. From
  the bookworm Mega Drive, to the Tsundere Saturn, to the OMG SO AWESOME Kawaii Dreamcast, they are all entertaining and
  work well with the original console in mind. The dynamics the characters have together, and the way they react to
  situations are reminiscent to the original consoles, and is quite enjoyable. The way that they mesh with the SEGA
  worlds is entertaining, and mildly surprising. Really, I wasn't expecting anything out of them, or out of anything
  original this show has to offer, but I was pleasantly surprised. </p><h4 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h116185"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>A love letter to SEGA Fans</h4>
<img alt src="./1058762121634547116.png"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> As a show that talks about SEGA stuff, there's a ton of neat SEGA references all
  over the place... and the references are pretty well done! From the well known characters like Sonic, to the more
  obscure like Fantasy Zone, there's a ton of SEGA references and they are all pretty enjoyable, and well thought out.
  If you've spent a decent amount of time playing older SEGA consoles and SEGA games, the references that this show will
  make will put a smile on your face, like it did mine, while learning a thing or two about it in the process.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> Personally, I loved this bit here where they show the genesis and she's dressed up in a
  way that screams MURRICA' (except the Canadians had the Genesis as well, so yeah :/), and the episodes with Jet Set
  Radio and Puyo Puyo really made me smile. The show is totally self aware with what it's doing as well, which makes it
  that much more enjoyable.</p>

<div class="ooo3c9-0 PpIMM align--bleed has-video media-large video-embed embed-frame"><span class="flex-video widescreen"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6mERS8UM12c" width="560"></iframe><span class="js_recommend" data-chomp-id="6mERS8UM12c" data-recommend-id="youtube://6mERS8UM12c" data-recommended="false" id="youtube-6mERS8UM12c"></span></span></div><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> Were you really expecting anything here? The show uses cheap CG throughout most of the
  show, which helps cut costs and blend the characters more seamlessly into the games. but it's really nothing special.
  The games are produced faithfully, and the models of the main characters are pretty nice at times, but it all has that
  cheapy look to it. Shouldn't really hinder your enjoyment of the show though. As for the music and voice acting,
  average job overall.. but that OP Music... it's so catchy....</p>
<h4 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h116187"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>It's Exactly What It Says on
  the Tin</h4>
<img alt src="./1058790216332575080.png"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> You're getting exactly what the description says: A short anime about SEGA Consoles
  going to a SEGA high school. It's for SEGA fans and nobody else, so keep that in mind, and don't expect greatness:
  there's nothing great about this show, i t's just this kind of silly comedy show with no real depth to it. It doesn't
  have a real plot or any amazing writing, it's an episodic show where every episode or two goes over an aspect of SEGA.
  Other than the references, if you've seen one episode, you've seen them all, and there's nothing that will suprise you
  about it. I mean it kinda has to, considering it's that it's trying to do a lot with only 10 minutes, and a pretty
  small budget, but I wish it was a bit better. </p><h4 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h116188"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>Humor</h4>
<img alt src="./hpnsc2yprs1a12qafd9n.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> As a short show with a quirky concept, this show relies on the humor to carry the
  show, and it's pretty hit or miss. The referential stuff like I mentioned earlier is pretty solid, but the rest of the
  stuff is just average, or pretty bad. The writing for the comedy isn't really anything special, and a lot of the times
  the execution can just fall on it's face. Sometimes, they seriously try to be funny, but it's not really funny at
  all.</p>
<img alt src="./jzzhei8vxtz4auul24zt.png"/>
<h4 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h116189"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>Cringe-Worthy</h4>
<img alt src="./1058790216403415912.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> Sometimes it's really, really cringe-worthy, which made me want to drop the show
  because of how bad the writing was. Most of the humor works fine, but at times, it misses... and when it does, it
  really misses. Most of this stems from the show bagging on Saturn, which is fine, but it's done so poorly at times
  that it makes me want to just rage quit. Here's an example: one of the running gags in the show is the Elf from Golden
  Axe apparently fell in love with Saturn, so whenever he appears, all the characters treat saturn like she's into that
  kind of thing... and it fails. <strong>REALLY BADLY</strong>.</p>
<img alt src="./eu3gwqwanwldgv8fvqrt.png"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> What more is there to be said about this? It's a short anime for SEGA fans that
  really knows it's audience, but with hit and miss comedy. It's interesting, but it's a short anime that can't really
  do much.</p>
