Hey, I'm Rockmandash12, and I thought it's about time to do a ConTAYct page now that there's a [direcTAYry](https://tay.kinja.com/tay-directory-1533543595), and I've been on TAY for a bit now.

I've only started to frequent TAY recently (before I just lurked on Kotaku, Gizmodo and Lifehacker), mostly doing reviews. I'm a fan of Tech, Games (primarily RPGs, Platformers, Visual Novels), Anime, etc.

If you need to contact me, I'm usually available on Skype, which is Rockmandash12 (very different!). If you want to play some games, my steam is Rockmandash12 and my PSN is Rockmandash12.... seeing a pattern here? Email is Kevinmai813\@gmail.com
