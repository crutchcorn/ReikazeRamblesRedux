    Various Light Novel publishers have announced that Amazon’s been pulling
    Light Novels and Manga off of their platform.

    to J-Novel Club, Today <em>No Game No Life</em> from Yen Press has been
    removed, which is the first time someone other than J-Novel Club has
    mentioned that Amazon was doing this. <br />
  </p>
  <p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">
    J-Novel also verified that everything in the<em>
      The Greatest Magicmaster’s Retirement Plan, I Shall Survive Using Potions,
      How Not to Summon a Demon Lord, </em
    >and <em>Clockwork Planet</em> series have been removed.
  </p>
  <p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">
    According to J-Novel, these happened without any notification, and while
    Amazon has said it was because of Kindle Content removal,<span

        just like Valve and removing Visual Novels from S
        <!-- -->team</a
      ></span
    >, Amazon has not given any explicit reason. This lack of transparency is
    incredibly frustrating, and has lead many to to speculate the removal is
    simply because of the anime art style that L<!-- -->
    ight N<!-- -->
    ovels have. This speculation stems because there are many works like
    <em>My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom! </em>and
    <em>I Shall Survive Using Potions</em> that don’t have any ecchi or
    questionable elements yet are getting taken down. If Ecchi is the problem,
    then expressing that would go a long way. If it’s the anime art style then
    it’s another case of western censorship of expression from Asia simply
    because they don’t like the anime.

  <p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">
    As Amazon is one of the largest players in the industry when it comes to
    book retailers, this will have a major effect on the already small Light
    Novel industry in the west. Consider supporting other retailers like
    RightStuf, Bookwalker that specialize in Otaku works.
