<div><img alt src="./1313401717743036996.png"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">When trapped in a do or die situation, how do you react? How do you change when
  faced with a situation that forces you to evolve, and pushes you to to your absolute limits? What do you do when the
  darkness of death is encroaching you, and all you have is just a glimmer of hope? This is what you are faced with this
  in<em> 999: Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors,</em> and I found something that I never would have without it.</p>

<img alt src="./1313401717895772996.jpg"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">When your life is on the line, everything is different. In <em>999</em>, this statement is
the basis of the game, and a core reason why it’s so great: we follow our protagonist Junpei as he is kidnapped and is
forced upon a sinking cruse-liner to play the Nonary Game, a game where his life is on the line. Along with 8 other
participants, he has to seek a way out by going through finding the door with the number 9 while overcoming the many
obstacles in their way. They only have 9 hours or else they’ll sink, they have to follow Zero (the person who set this
whole game up)‘s rules of the digital root or else they’ll explode, and they have to find all of the mysteries aboard
this ship or else they will never manage to survive this grueling experience. It’s a tense, extremely engaging, well
written story that does everything well, and is one that’ll hook any unassuming fan and blast them in a ride.</p>

999 as the first game, Virtue’s Last Reward as the Sequel) is a collection of everything done right in the Infinity
series then amped up to another level, polishing everything you can imagine: it excels with its premise to hook you
in, it has the extremely well executed character interactions and mystery you would come to expect from Uchikoshi, it
has nearly perfect pacing throughout the story, which is executed in a way that keeps you hooked and engaged
throughout. The SciFi elements of the story are executed in a way that intrigues and engages, it creates an amazing
atmosphere that only improves immersion and to top it all off, and it has plot twists that will blow your mind.</p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">It manages to do this with its biggest differentiator that this story has: its
  ability to manipulate tension, and mood, using all of its elements to influence you. This story has a lot of tools
  under its belt, but they use it to make you feel like you’re in the situation, making you feel everything that the
  characters feel, pushing you to the limits. The work has really quick pacing makes this game almost like a roller
  coaster, exhilarating and moving, always influencing you with the ever-present knowledge that death is imminent, a
  feeling that is something rarely replicated in another game. The feeling of being trapped yet having a time limit to
  your doom while trying to work with people who may or may not be trying to kill you… it gets you suspicious, it gets
  you nervous, it gets you moved, it raises your adrenaline and the way that this story influences the reader in such a
  way is up with the bests out there, making it a trip to remember. It creates the hollow and abandoned atmosphere that
  the infinity games rocked at, but since the tense of the game was amped up and the mood was made more engaging, it’s
  even better.</p>
<img alt src="./1313401718006746180.png"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">That being said, it’s not just how the story handles the plot, the plot itself is
  pretty well written as well. The characters are interesting and engaging because they are fleshed out and developed,
  the word choice used in the descriptions and conversations are entertaining, being funny and witty when it wants to
  (<strong>RESPECT THE FUNYARINPA!) </strong>while being serious and interesting when it needs to, and the intricate and
  engaging SciFi elements... just wow. With the concepts of All-ICE, Morphigenic Fields, and more, the SciFi in<em>
    999</em> is one of the best handled, and the way they make it integral to the plot along with the human story of the
  premise is done really well here, enabling them to create the extremely strong narrative that the game creates.. and a
  strong narrative it is. Really, I have nothing but praise for the story, and everything about it is pretty much damn
  near perfect... so great.</p>
<hr class="gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw"/>
<img alt src="./1313401718069378628.png"/>

<img alt src="./1313401718108892484.jpg"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Unlike the typical visual novel which is solely reading text and making choices, 999 is one
of the few visual novels that actually have real gameplay, and this comes in the form of puzzle sections, the rooms
where you need to find the way out to progress the story. What makes the gameplay a stroke of genius however isn’t
either of the gameplay modes, but how the game manages to blend these two elements, alternating between both
seamlessly, never burning you out on either while maintaining the insane level of tension that makes this game great.
While many times gameplay can inhibit your experience with the story, this is almost never the case in 999, where the
gameplay is an essential aspect of the game, complimenting pretty much everything here.</p>

<img alt src="./1313401718184748868.png"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Also, while the best aspect is how each are handled together, each element is solid by
itself. I appreciated how the difficulty curve of the puzzles is pretty solid and gameplay uses the DS’s hardware
pretty well to make the gameplay pretty good. As for the VN elements, while I wish there was a better skipping
mechanism (it’s wonky and slow), they did a great job integrating multiple routes into the game, with your experiences
you’ve played through effecting the stories in a way that it doesn’t feel like you’re wasting your time. I
particularly enjoyed the elements that popped out of the safe ending while you were playing the True end, and how they
kinda hint at the other endings as you play through the game (Hello, Axe ending!). Its structure and gameplay
compliment the core of the story, and it’s a big reason why I fell in love with this genre.</p>

<img alt src="./1313401718259563588.jpg"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Also, I have to mention here that when Askys ported 999 to iOS under the name <em>999: The
Novel</em>, <strong>they took out the puzzles. </strong>While I haven’t personally played through that version, I’ve
heard nothing but lukewarm to negative responses on that decision, and how it really negatively effects the game. The
puzzles let you have a breather, and they manage to seamlessly transition between important story elements, some that
happen while playing, so seeing this awkard transition where they flash a black screen saying they solved the puzzles
is just pretty clunky, like watching a LP as you try to play the game. The original used the hardware in interesting
ways, engaging you throughout... the iOS version is a port that works, but could be quite a bit better. Stick to the
DS version if you can.</p>

<hr class="gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw"/>
<img alt src="./1313401718353272132.png"/>

<img alt src="./1313401718395515972.png"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">I guess they do the job? </p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">The Visuals of<em> 999 </em>look
quite dated by having CG that feels like something that I’d find in an old PS1 game, but it’s that dated look that
adds charm to the game, and makes it interesting, reminiscent of an age when adventure games like this still roamed
the lands. Ignoring fidelity, it has a nice design aesthetic, but it doesn’t do that much to stand out, it tries to do
what it does well. It’s definitely not the best looking game, but it gets the job done and most players shouldn’t
really have any issues with it. A nice thing about the iOS port is that they up the graphics, rendering the game in a
higher resolution with redrawn sprites, (which you can tell by looking at the difference between some of the
screenshots in this review) but they don’t get everything and when they show the DS graphics, it looks woefully dated.
Also, I quite like the look of the characters due to the fact that they are pretty well done 2d sprites and they have
really unique designs that make them stand out.</p>

  best atmospheric soundtracks that are available in gaming. <em>999</em> has a soundtrack that exceeds your
  expectations, doing much more than you would ever hope a soundtrack to do by capturing the essence of everything the
  game is meant to be, with all the emotion it wants you to feel, then throwing it back at you in a way that will leave
  you impacted. It’s a soundtrack that wants you to feel where you are, feel what it’s like around and the stakes that
  are in the air just by listening to it. </p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">This is a soundtrack that will make you feel, doing all it can to manipulate you,
  while sounding nice in the process. While it’s mostly ambiance, it’s done relatively well by emphasizing the strong
  tones and melodies that really effect the sound and the mood. When you add to the fact that<em> 999</em> is the master
  at manipulating mood, the soundtrack amplifies this even more, making you feel all the tension as possible, moving you
  in ways that you wouldn’t expect. Its a soundtrack that serves a purpose, doing more than just being background music,
  while being some of the best background music I’ve heard.. it tells you the core of the world, the core of the
  situation done in a way that is to be admired.</p>
<div class="ooo3c9-0 PpIMM has-video media-large embed-frame"><span class="flex-video widescreen"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PLQkzLYjLbYJyou_abtERNYejtpluOgYqT" width="560"></iframe><span class="js_recommend" data-chomp-id="PLQkzLYjLbYJyou_abtERNYejtpluOgYqT" data-recommend-id="youtube://PLQkzLYjLbYJyou_abtERNYejtpluOgYqT" data-recommended="false" id="youtube-PLQkzLYjLbYJyou_abtERNYejtpluOgYqT"></span></span></div><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">This all is even more impressive when you consider that they were limited to the DS’s
  hardware, having to execute midi clips in a chip tune-esque manner to make such an impact, showing that soundtrack
  does not need to be fancy and orchestral to be effective. It’s simplicity allows its main melody to punch harder, to
  have a stronger effect, to affect you more, in a world where music has to be bombastic and loud, explosive and large.
  It’s a soundtrack that makes the most out of what it has while executing it in a way that will make it stand out in
  time, a soundtrack that does what most in this industry have abandoned but still showing that chip tune is still a
  great option. It’s just fantastic.</p>

<img alt src="./1313401718552271172.jpg"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><em>999</em> is truly a game that is more than the sum of the parts, where the
experience playing through this game absolutely shines through. Even though I’ve been gushing so much about this game,
it really isn’t enough: the experience of the entire work as a whole is flat out impressive, hooking you in and moving
you through an amazing ride that will rarely ever be matched.</p>

<img alt src="./1313401718594458180.png"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">To emphasize how impressed and hooked I was, I’d like to tell you what my first experience
was like playing <em>999. </em>When I picked up the game, I had absolutely no clue what I was getting into. While I
heard it was pretty good, I didn’t really know anything about it, what it was about, or what I was about to
experience. What awaited me was a game that would <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://rockmandash12.kinja.com/why-i-love-visual-novels-so-much-and-how-i-got-into-th-1571227739",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://rockmandash12.kinja.com/why-i-love-visual-novels-so-much-and-how-i-got-into-th-1571227739" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">entrench me into my new favorite genre</a></span>,
a game that I view as the pinnacle of storytelling in video games, and a game that would blow my mind so much that it
changed my perspective of games forever. To me, <em>999</em> was a game that was so gripping, so compelling, with an
amazing atmosphere, and just amazing writing: I started the game at 7 PM, and when I finished the first route, it was
3 in the morning. It hooked me like no other game has hooked me before, and no game has hooked me since, and it did
this with a compelling story, writing that makes you connect with the characters, writing that engages you with the
work, writing that is both interesting SciFi and just an interesting story in general, and the way that it uses horror
to control the mood and tension is one of the best out there. Everything it does fits in to make your experience with
the story excellent, everything is done extremely well and the time spent playing this has completely changed who I
am.</p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">To me, 999 is an absolute masterpiece in writing, a game I’ll adore to no end. It’s
  not perfect, but it’s damn near close to it and probably the closest I think I’ll ever see, unless Uchikoshi can pull
  it off again. It’s the game that controlled a beautiful narrative with amazing ideas and the best control of tension
  I’ve ever seen. The game with twists and a sense of mystery that will never be matched, the game that got me pulling
  all nighters because I was hooked that much. The game with the perfect atmosphere, the game that has shaped the way
  I’ve viewed a story. It’s everything I’ve ever wanted in a narrative, and since then has shaped my expectations of
  games. It’s the best game I’ve ever played and nothing will ever match up to it in my heart, as one of the few games
  I’ll ever give a 10/10. I plead you, pick this game up now. You will not regret it.</p>
