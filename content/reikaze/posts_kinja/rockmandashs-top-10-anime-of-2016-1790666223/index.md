<div><video autoplay="" loop="" muted=""><source src="./tmky74yt3onpoiadf8eo.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">2016. Just hearing this number brings memories of pain and suffering, a result of
  the terrible year that it represents. Thankfully for us anime fans though, we didn’t see this trend continue with the
  hobby we love: 2016 was a great year for anime, blowing us away with amazing experiences, wonderful experiments and
  more. Here’s what I thought were the best this year.<br/></p>

  on Anime in 2016</h2>
<img alt src="./ddwfnnrr94fbybxi9alf.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">While there was a lot of great anime this year but I have to say, this year was
  bizarre for anime. I’ve been watching anime seasonally for the past 4 years, and they usually followed a rather
  predictable cycle: Winter with a few good shows but VERY STRONG shows at the top, Spring with a boatload of good
  shows, summer being pretty average, and Fall being full of the blockbuster shows of the season, but this year.. well a
  few went along with the cycle, others said NOPE. Winter and Spring were on point, being some of the best anime seasons
  I’ve had the chance to experience, but the other 2, were some of the most lackluster. I’d have to say overall it was a
  good year for anime, but like the rest of the year, definitely bizzare.<br/></p>
<hr class="gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw"/><h2 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h101445"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>Rules
</h2>
<img alt src="./hcszrfus9zdi8zjqzgcv.png"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">My rules of this list are simple: if it aired/released this year, it can go on this
  list. I don’t see the point in only giving a show one chance during it’s airing season, and this is my list so I’ll
  list my favorite shows regardless of what season it started on. If this means that one show hogs the top spot for 2
  seasons, than good for that show! If it’s an OVA or movie that came out during the duration of the season I fell in
  love with, then it may be there. Also, I think that the seasonal split is arbitrary and unnecessary, so it’s
  completely gone here. Sorry about that, but that’s how I’m doing it.<br/></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Just an FYI,
  the placement of the show in the list is mostly based on my experience and enjoyment of the work, so if you’re
  wondering why something isn’t where you think it should be or you can’t really tell via the justification, that’s
  probably why. Keep in mind, just because a show is lower on the list doesn’t mean it’s bad - all of these are great,
  and a lower placement isn’t a mark against the show, at this point it’s nearly all personal preference.</p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Justification &amp; Thoughts: </strong><em>What a fantastic way to start a
  list. </em>I marathoned this one very recently after hearing members of AniTAY praise it to the moon, and even though
  I hesitated because Fantasy + Magical Girl aren’t really my cup of tea, what awaited me was some of the best animation
  of the year, some of the best storytelling you will find in anime, a cohesive experience that would constantly blow
  your mind, and an anime that can actually create a compelling mystery with fantastic twists. I just wish the last
  episode didn’t leave me like this:</p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Justification &amp; Thoughts: </strong>We’ve seen this before, a guy gets
  sucked into a fantasy world… but you’ve never seen this as hilarious as <em>Konosuba</em>. While everything seems
  normal on first impression, when you look into this world, you’ll quickly realize that it’s absolutely hilarious and
  insane, and add to this insane world an equally insane cast and you got humor that is some of the best around and that
  really hold the show throughout. Every time I watched it, I knew I was going to have a good time and this show never
  disappointed, always making me laugh while putting a big stupid grin on my face. It’s great to see Studio Deen do so
  well after all of the consistent failure they’ve seen, and I can’t wait for season 2 in a few weeks. :)</p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Justification &amp; Thoughts: </strong>While <em>Flying Witch </em>is
  technically about witches, it’s the quintessential slice of life, spending it’s time just doing stuff. It’s hard to
  for me to describe why many love this show so much, but every moment is pure bliss, enjoyable and relaxing to make
  your day all that much better. With funny character interactions, calming and enjoyable scenes, and entertaining
  moments of life that can’t help but put a smile on your face, I fell in love with this show and so did many others.
  It’s Slice of Life but it’s the best kind of Slice of Life, one that immerses yourself into the relaxing world it has
  to offer. Definitely worth a shot if you’ve ever enjoyed a slice of life show.</p>

  excited to go and watch it. Nothing beats that, and I hope we get more Ace in the future.</p>

  and many wrong with it’s immense quality. While in a season of really solid shows, <em>Tanaka-kun</em> was the show
  that got the most enjoyment and laughs out of me due to it’s fantastic cast and hilarious relationships. I loved every

  filtered in, the relationships got more interesting, the show got more jokes, and the show consistently got me excited

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Justification &amp; Thoughts: </strong>With ReLife, the question of “What’s
  my favorite show of the season” was over before it even began (consider it an Honorable 1st Place). Crunchyroll, for
  some odd reason, decided to release this show all at the beginning of the season, and I love them for it, enabling me
  to marathon a show that perfectly matches my preferences. I’m a sucker for romantic dramas, and to see one of them
  done so well in this fashion is something I really enjoyed. ReLife, more than anything, is about life, giving one a
  second chance while looking at what makes this tick, and this fuels a thrilling ride of character interactions that
  allow the viewer to get more and more attached to the cast as they watch. Along with that, ReLife has a great cast of
  characters with fascinating personalities, and plus, it’s funny, keeping the show always engaging to watch. Definitely
  a great time, and I can’t wait for more.</p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Justification &amp; Thoughts:</strong> Yes, my number 2 of this year is the
  best movie everyone except you have seen. When the internet started to sing it’s praises over the glory of<em> Kimi no
    Na wa</em>, I wasn’t the slightest bit surprised. That is, because during AX 2016, I was able to watch the world
  premiere of this movie and my mind was completely blown. While I always appreciated Shinkai’s works, I would be what
  most would describe as a Shinkai Skeptic because I would generally paint a negative picture on them when I talked
  about them. This is because I never really was engaged with them and the story they had to tell, but <em>Kimi no Na
    wa</em>... had my crying in my seat. Every moment was engaging, every moment was beautful, and most importantly, I
  was actually enjoying it, unlike so many of his works. This is one of the best anime movies ever made, and it’s easily
  one of the best this year has to offer. Definitely check it out when you have the chance.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">If you’re interested in reading more thoughts about <em>Kimi no Na wa</em>, <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","http://anitay.kinja.com/kimi-no-na-wa-your-name-the-anitay-review-1783309415",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://anitay.kinja.com/kimi-no-na-wa-your-name-the-anitay-review-1783309415" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">check out the AniTAY review</a></span>!</p>

  as a recount to an ex-convict and aspiring pupil, <em>Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu</em> is a character drama
  revolving around two budding performers of Japan’s oral comedy tradition—rakugo. Primarily set in the post-WWII Showa
  Era, the starkness of the period heightens the struggles of the friends as they attempt to make rakugo not only an
  emotional release, but also a livelihood. With life increasingly fraught with the tribulations of adulthood, they
  discover what it takes to truly succeed in this art form of “fallen words”, and the harsh sacrifices that must be
  made. - <em>Plot Description by Nomadic Dec from the </em><span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","http://anitay.kinja.com/the-12-anime-of-winter-2016-you-should-be-watching-1759823518",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://anitay.kinja.com/the-12-anime-of-winter-2016-you-should-be-watching-1759823518" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>12 Anime of Winter 2016 You Should Be Watching Article</em></a></span></p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><strong>Justification &amp; Thoughts:</strong> When talking about how great <em>Rakugo </em>is,
  where do you even start? There was never a doubt in my mind that this was my anime of the year, it’s a fantastic show
  that (in my opinion) contends with the best I’ve seen, a show that ticks all my boxes by telling an interesting
  historical story on the decline of the art form of rakugo and the tale of our interesting characters that are fleshed
  out and feel real. While the plot of <em>Rakugo</em> may sound boring because it’s literally about telling stories, it
  is the execution, how it tells the story that makes this great, being able to handle all of its elements extremely
  well. The show has fantastic pacing, solid visuals, a great score, amazing characters and the best part: it’s
  consistently engaging with every episode being better than the last. It’s definitely a must watch, my favorite of the
  season. my favorite for the year, and one of my favorite anime ever. It’s a timepiece that displays a story of the
  past extremely well, and a shining example of what shows like this should be like. I never thought I’d say this, but
  well played Studio Deen, can’t wait for more in a few weeks. </p>
