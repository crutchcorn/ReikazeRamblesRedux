<div><img alt src="./ghadk2k3nmu8lvmqolwy.png"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> For those who like anime movies, a new film by Mamoru Hosoda brings a round of
  excitement, as he constantly pumps out quality films. Being the next film after the critically acclaimed <em>Wolf
    Children</em> has to be tough, but <em>The Boy and the Beast</em> is a film that does not disappoint, adding another
  great movie to Hosoda’s list of works. </p>

  Beast </em>is Another Great Coming Of Age Story</h3>
<img alt src="./nxyuigc6twhuuscvwwrd.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Mamoru Hosoda is great at constructing stories that are polished and entertaining,
  and to nobody’s surprise, <em>The Boy and the Beast </em>is no different. If you’ve liked the stories in his previous
  films, or if you like Ghibli-like films you’ll be perfectly at home here as the style of the story he tells is very
  similar, but good and different enough to keep things interesting and engaging. While the story isn’t perfect (I’ll
  talk about the issues later), Hosoda’s consistency with writing is to the point that every time I go and watch one of
  his works, I come in expecting a well constructed film that’ll put a smile on my face, and <em>The Boy and the
    Beast</em> provides that with a coming of age and great character interactions between the cast.</p>
<div class="ooo3c9-0 PpIMM align--bleed has-video media-large video-embed embed-frame"><span class="flex-video widescreen"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-0NDXOeb-lY" width="560"></iframe><span class="js_recommend" data-chomp-id="-0NDXOeb-lY" data-recommend-id="youtube://-0NDXOeb-lY" data-recommended="false" id="youtube--0NDXOeb-lY"></span></span></div><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">We start out the story following a 9 year old child named Ren (later known as Kyuuta),
  right after his mother has passed away. In despair because of his loss and curiosity where his father was, Ren decides
  to run away from his guardians into the busy streets of Tokyo with no plan on what to do. While brooding in the
  streets, he encounters a beast who we learn later on is named Kumatetsu. Ren follows Kumatetsu into the world of
  beasts (called <em>Jūtengai</em> in the film<em>)</em>, where Kumatetsu takes in Ren as an apprentice, and they live
  and grow together, each fixing the flaws that other has while developing their character in general. It’s an
  interesting premise and even though it’s tried and true, they handle it well: due to the way that they treat
  Ren/Kyuuta, instead having it a temporary adventure like most films would, this is his life. It’s not until he’s much
  older that he returns to our world, and this dichotomy between his worlds is an aspect that is handled well, one of my
  favorite parts of the story. </p>

<img alt src="./jzewc3t4bogkuxjyvck5.jpg"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><em>The Boy and the Beast </em>first and foremost though,<em> </em>is a film
about growing up, about growth and camaraderie, a happy and upbeat story with a fair bit of comedy about family and
how those around you influence you. Everyone here wants to be stronger, they want to improve themselves to beat the
challenges they have to confront. Seeing this strengthening of the self and others is almost awe inspiring, with every
character bettering each other (even if some of the characters are rather one dimensional). Also, I’d like to say that
<em>The Boy and the Beast </em>handles it’s themes really well, better than most films I’ve seen recently: it doesn’t
necessarily shove down its themes of strength and growth down your throats, but it does make them prominent. It truly
feels like every scene was focused around them, and this is something I rather appreciated.<br/></p>

<img alt src="./ce82qhmqj6qg1eljcaat.jpg"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">The effects of these themes is that it is a movie that gets you to care about the
characters, and it consistently has great character interactions. While our main duo of Ren/Kyuuta and Kumatetsu steal
the show and put a smile on the face of the viewers every time they are on the screen, every time any of the
characters interact, they build off on each other. They interact in a way that feels authentic while being
entertaining, they feel like they are truly growing and interacting in a way that people who had those personalities
would, and it’s limited cast allows you to get to know the personalities of those in the movie and enjoy them all.
Through it’s great characters, the work gets you to care about the story it provides, and the way it handles this is
rather amazing in my opinion.</p>

<img alt src="./x7vy9boaihnwzvgljho1.jpg"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Overall though, <em>The Boy and the Beast </em>is another well polished Mamoru
Hosoda coming of age film, one that will please anyone who liked his films and more: it’s a well executed story that
is moving and engaging, one of the most enjoyable stories I’ve seen and it’s one that’ll appeal to many. It’s a movie
full of character and charm that’ll get anyone interested in the film, and it’s a blast to watch while maintaining the
quality we all expect from it.</p>

  Boy and the Beast </em>is Hosoda’s Best Looking Film Yet</h3>
<img alt src="./dzgy1do8ybstdho4fevy.jpg"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">If you’ve been paying attention to the staff who’ve been working on Hosoda’s films,
  you’d know that they’ve traditionally been made by Studio Madhouse, a studio known for their high production values
  and amazing visuals in works like known for works like <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","http://anitay.kinja.com/one-punch-man-the-ani-tay-review-1749225072",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://anitay.kinja.com/one-punch-man-the-ani-tay-review-1749225072" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>One Punch Man</em></a></span><em>, </em>Satoshi Kon’s films, and the absolutely
  stunning <em>Redine. </em> <em>The Boy and The Beast </em>is the first Hosoda film to completely buck this trend,
  instead made by Studio Chizu, which is Hosoda’s own animation studio. This honestly is not a concern however, because
  if I didn’t check to see who made this movie, I honestly wouldn’t have been the wiser: this is the best looking Hosoda
  film yet, and man is it gorgeous. From the absolutely <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","http://imgur.com/a/2udkD",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://imgur.com/a/2udkD" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">gorgeous backgrounds</a></span>
  to the amazing visual directing with amazing shot composition, the visuals are some of the best that animation has to
  offer. If you asked me, it’s up there with <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","http://tay.kinja.com/the-garden-of-words-the-ani-tay-review-1524606376",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://tay.kinja.com/the-garden-of-words-the-ani-tay-review-1524606376" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Shinkai movies</a></span> in my eyes
  with an insane amount of polish and detail in the shots that one can’t help but be impressed by.</p>
<div class="ooo3c9-0 PpIMM align--bleed has-video media-large video-embed embed-frame"><span class="flex-video widescreen"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RL-jmLp7Tng" width="560"></iframe><span class="js_recommend" data-chomp-id="RL-jmLp7Tng" data-recommend-id="youtube://RL-jmLp7Tng" data-recommended="false" id="youtube-RL-jmLp7Tng"></span></span></div><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">It’s more than just scenery though: the movie is based around a specific fight and the
  animation is silky smooth, fight or no fight. In the fight scenes though, it’s well choreographed, and the animation
  throughout the scenes are great: fast and fluid, beautiful and consistent. Motion is impressive and the world looks
  interesting and alive, with the way they show the small details being the absolute highlight: they show like the way
  that sweat and blood looks and moves looking impressive throughout and makes the film look better than your
  traditional anime film. I just wish all anime could be this nice visually, but that’s a pipe dream.<br/></p>

<img alt src="./wpz65fusviz09mz4wdgc.jpg"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Speaking of things that I wish all works could have but is impossible, I have to
mention how much I appreciate the shot composition, and how much it made a difference. Most directors nowadays don’t
really pay that much attention to visually directing the shot and using the frame nearly as much as Hosoda does in
this work (IMO), and Hosoda uses it so well that one of his previous works, <em>Wolf Children</em>, got a great video
by <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdSKot0psNg",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdSKot0psNg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Every Frame a Painting</em></a></span><em> </em>which
explained how great some of it’s shots are. (this video being just a specific shot actually.) The way that Hosoda uses
the position of the scene to enhance your experience of the events or even tell stories is absolutely fantastic and
impressed me consistently throughout the film. If you go and watch this film, you’re in for a treat with the visuals,
as they are some of the best animation has to offer.<br/></p>

<hr class="gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw"/><h3 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h110518"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>The Dub
  is Pretty Great</h3>
<div class="ooo3c9-0 PpIMM align--bleed has-video media-large video-embed embed-frame"><span class="flex-video widescreen"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mXwoPcOORvY" width="560"></iframe><span class="js_recommend" data-chomp-id="mXwoPcOORvY" data-recommend-id="youtube://mXwoPcOORvY" data-recommended="false" id="youtube-mXwoPcOORvY"></span></span></div><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"> Normally, anime fans here on AniTAY typically watch our anime in subtitles, having to read
  the words so we can understand it because there are usually no dubs out for the anime we are watching. Movies, which
  when brought over to the West are almost always an exception to this, and with The Boy and the Beast, I had the chance
  to go and see the movie in the theatres, in a dub. I gotta say, I rather liked it; all the actors really fit their
  characters well and they all gave a great performance. I am not an expert, but the experience listening to them
  throughout was solid and never once did I really think that it was unnatural or that someone else should have played a
  role. Everyone did their job well and it was one of the better dubs that I’ve seen (though, movie dubs are usually
  better than their TV counterparts for anime). </p>

<img alt src="./v6dp574ixaazrf5rwgng.png"/><h3 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h110519"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>The Story Isn’t Exactly
Perfect...</h3>
<img alt src="./depsvbfk8eyzxnw6hhjj.jpg"/>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">... because as much praise as I give it, it’s not a perfect film, and it’s weakest
  parts are the writing issues. These issues aren’t gamebreaking perse, but they do effect how one experiences the film.
  The most notable is the fact that it’s not all that original - we have a traditional coming of age story with a
  mythical world, and this may bother some. It’s well done, so I don’t think it’s that much of an issue, but if you’re
  looking for something innovative and different (or if you were looking for another feelzy <em>Wolf Children</em>),
  this isn’t it. To add to that, the direction of the story is rather unclear throughout the beginning part of the
  story, making it hard to grasp what the story is trying to do. You can stay on the ride and just go through what the
  story does, but knowing how and why a story does something through it’s direction is a trait that many appreciate.
</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Also, you’ll find at the end of the film that there are some minor issues as well. The
  story in the latter half of the story starts shifting from our world and the world of the beasts (Juutengai), and at
  that point the story started getting a bit messier, by moving from certain scenes too fast, doing things that seem far
  fetched and out of context in the world they built to the point that it may stretch your suspension of disbelief and
  having a romance that one can describe a cliche and generic, even if the characters do build off of each other in an
  interesting way. These aren’t something that’s going to break the movie, but it’s definitely worth mentioning.</p>

<img alt src="./m6dfrmxjbo6c7f0fq8y1.png"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Also, the antagonist that was essentially pulled out of nowhere at the end, while
making sense thematically, felt rather forced and like a bunch of BS. You still have something you can improve
Hosoda!</p>

  Background Music is entirely in the Background</strong></h3>
<div class="ooo3c9-0 PpIMM align--bleed has-video media-large video-embed embed-frame"><span class="flex-video widescreen"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rkzj81Amcnc" width="560"></iframe><span class="js_recommend" data-chomp-id="rkzj81Amcnc" data-recommend-id="youtube://rkzj81Amcnc" data-recommended="false" id="youtube-rkzj81Amcnc"></span></span></div><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><em> The Boy and the Beast</em> has rather great music, each fitting with the world and the
  scene it is trying to create, but like so many other movies, it’s completely sitting in the background, only serving
  to augment the other aspects of the story without portraying any sense of importance or identity itself. The whole
  movie has solid tracks composed of the traditional, grandiose tracks you would associate with someone like Ghibli, but
  as I was writing this review I couldn’t recall any track or scene where there was music that particularly stood out,
  and that’s not the best sign to me. It signifies to me at least that attention wasn’t put to this aspect as much as
  others. This definitely won’t hurt your experience too much as so many films treat the soundtrack as completely in the
  background, but given everything else, it seems like a bit of a letdown to me, even if it’s good. </p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">From the engaging coming of age tale to the breathtaking visuals, Mamoru Hosoda has
  created another fantastic tale that anyone can enjoy. While it’s not the most original, it’s a movie that is done
  exceedingly well and is enjoyable and likeable to the point that you can recommend it to anyone. If you asked me, I’d
  say <em>The Boy and the Beast </em>is an amazing film that is definitely worth the price of admission.<br/></p>
