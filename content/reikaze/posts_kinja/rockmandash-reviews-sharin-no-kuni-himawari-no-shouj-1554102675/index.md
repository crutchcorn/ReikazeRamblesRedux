<div><img alt src="./qapalhh1wojdr7aq9sym.png"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Welcome to Rockmandash Reviews! After I finished the amazing <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","Internal link","http://tay.kotaku.com/g-senjou-no-maou-the-tay-review-1524540625",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://tay.kotaku.com/g-senjou-no-maou-the-tay-review-1524540625">G-Senjou no Maou</a></span>, I looked to see
  if there were any similar games to help fill that void. What I found was a game called Sharin no Kuni, Himiwari no
  Shoujo, another game also made by Akabesoft2. I was so sure that it was going to be amazing that I recommended it in
  my <span><a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","Internal link","http://tay.kotaku.com/the-beginners-guide-to-visual-novels-1541975662",{"metric25":1}]]' href="http://tay.kotaku.com/the-beginners-guide-to-visual-novels-1541975662">Beginner’s Guide to Visual Novels</a></span>
  article, and in my G-Senjou no Maou review without even playing it. Now that I’ve actually played this game, what do I
  think of it? Let’s find out in this review.</p>

<img alt src="./bc3xmvqrg8jxvk81avfo.png"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">I’ll say this at the very beginning. This is not a G-Senjou no Maou clone, it
  does things very differently than G-Senjou no maou. It’s a much slower game, with a more slice of life pacing. Not
  much actually happens in the game, as the game spends most of the time character building and talking, so if you are
  looking for another mystery thriller, look somewhere else. It’s light hearted for the most part, but it can be quite
  deep.</p>

<img alt src="./655288477720631621.jpg"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">What this game does have in it’s benifit is a very unique scenario, one you probably find
in a game like this. In an unknown country that is not japan, all all aspects of society in this country are
influenced by an elite stratum of people known as “Special High Class Individuals.” The best way to think of Special
High Class Individuals is to imagine a renaissance man who was amazing at many skills, but with judicial and political
power. It’s quite an interesting premise. The main character Kenichi Morita is a Special High Class Individual Cadet,
and he needs to pass a final test to actually become one. His final task is to get rid of “obligations” of 3 girls in
his hometown that he left from seven years ago. An obligation is a punishment for a crime, kinda like how you go to
jail if you kill a person, but instead they have to deal with specific restrictions. An example would be with Sachi,
who can only stay up 12 hours due to staying up and gambling online. It’s a very great setup that creates an
interesting world and keeps the story interesting. The fact that each arc has a well done, unique message adds so much
to the story, and it’s great. </p>

<img alt src="./zxyu2basbneotri4maa1.jpg"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">One thing that I’ll continuously praise <em>Sharin no Kuni</em> for is the
amazing character building that this game has. It’s very rare that you get a cast that’s as likable as this one. <em>Sharin
no Kuni </em>spends most of it’s time making the characters great, and it definitely succeeds in making a lovable
cast. Kenichi Morita is a very interesting character because of the issues with his past, and how he has a totally
different personality cloaked by an arrogant exterior. his habit of breaking the 4th wall is very interesting also.
Learning about his past is a big incentive to go on in the game, but discussing why would be spoilers so I’m going to
avoid that. The 3 girls with “obligations”, Sachi Mitsuhiro, Touka Oone and Natsumi Hinata are pretty enjoyable as
well, with each character going through insane amounts of character development in each chapter. I was a big fan
Natsumi’s chapter, as that’s when shit hits the fan, but her almost turtle-like protectionism from a bright character
was a very interesting arc. One character that has to be mentioned is Masaomi Houzuki, the Special High Class
Individual overlooking Kenichi. He’s cold, harsh, and manipulative but understanding. He’s really something else,
definitely a character you would not expect. The other supporting characters are pretty good also, as the game as a
pretty concise cast, and they are all executed well.</p>

<img alt src="./qeegr3kkxx7sejsaznmo.jpg"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">While it does many things well, the story does have quite a bit of flaws. This
game relies on your opinions on government to keep you interested, and it did for the most part, but at times it came
out very preachy, with some themes that was forced out. Also, I thought the world building could have been much
better. They mention interesting things in the world, but never develop it. The worst part about the world building
was how fixated it was on Japan... and it didn’t even give the name of the country it was set in, which just rubs me
the wrong way.. but this isn’t even the worst bit of sharin no Kuni. The biggest problem with this is in my opinion is
twofold: the story doesn’t really pick up until Natsumi’s arc in chapter 4, and it’s slice of life can be excruciating
especially if you are like me and just want to see the more exiting parts of the game. It’s a well written and unique
story, but I believe that it could have been executed better. </p>

<img alt src="./655288477887189829.jpg"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY"><em>Sharin no Kuni’s</em> visuals are pretty similar to <em>G-Senjou no Maou</em>, as it
runs on the same engine with good character art. The visuals are pretty nice and there’s nothing glaringly bad, but it
can be improved, as we once again meet the dreaded 800x600. The character art is pretty good, and some of the
background art is really nice, but a lot is left to your imagination sometimes. The game looks pretty good, I just
really wish it was in widescreen HD. It’s pretty nice in general.</p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">If there’s one thing that kills it though, it’s the H-scenes. Once again, I’ll pull
  the obligatory warning for these types of games. <strong>WARNING THIS IS AN EROGE MEANING IT HAS ADULT CONTENT. IF YOU
    ARE NOT A FAN, THEN YOU SHOULD SKIP THE SCENES.</strong> Seriously. They shouldn’t be here. They don’t add anything
  to the story, and they are annoying. </p><h4 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h117417"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>Visuals 8/10</h4>

The biggest issue is
  not the quality of the songs but the quantity of them. The songs themselves are well composed and help the mood, but
  Sharin no Kuni needs more variety. You hear the same few tracks over and over again, and it’s pretty disappointing.
  The usage of the tracks is also not the greatest in the world, but the tracks themselves are pretty good. As for the
  voice acting, it’s pretty good, I have no gripes with it.</p>

<img alt src="./xxtkq5m4a4vy9mmbyd13.jpg"/><p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">I have a bad habit of reading reviews as I work on my own reviews and before I
play the games. Many of the said reviews praise Sharin no Kuni like there’s no tomorrow... and here’s where I’ll
disagree with a good majority of people who reviewed this game. I didn’t think it was amazing, and there were some
parts where I was flat out bored. My problem is that it’s just not interesting for the majority of the story. The
slice of life lasts too long, and it’s not the best in the world. What will make or break this game for you is pacing
and the political speak...So if you liked G-Senjou no Maou and you can get over the difference in writing style, then
you’ll like this game. Personally? I was kinda disappointed with Sharin no Kuni. Maybe I came in with the wrong
mindset? Don’t get me wrong, it’s not bad, it’s just kinda disappointing and not my cup of tea.</p>

<h4 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h117419"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>Enjoyment - 7/10</h4>
<img alt src="./elxjg3ttm3e8d45bwglq.png"/>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Sharin no Kuni is a good game, but it was nothing like what I was expecting. It’s
  another good Akabeisoft2 game, but if you came in here expecting G-Senjou no Maou, you won’t get that. It’s a game
  with great characters and a great premise, but it could be better. If you can get over the problems it has, you’ll
  like it. </p><h2 class="sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ" id="h117420"><a class="js_header-anchor" id=""></a>Overall - 8/10

actually 5 endings, with each charecter having their own ending.... woops! I only played the last 2, so I guess I
haven’t really 100%ed the game. Sorry :|</p>
