		We typically expect that a side story is lesser than the original, but every
		assumption comes with exceptions. With<em>
			Muv-Luv Unlimited: The Day After</em
		>, I’m delighted to say that age provided exactly that: a side story that’s
		as good, if not better, than many parts of the main series. With 4 episodes
		currently out that are all great in their own ways,
		<em>Muv-Luv: The Day After</em> provides experiences that remind me why I
		started to play visual novels in the first place.

		This review of <em>Muv-Luv Unlimited: The Day</em> After assumes that you

		and <em>Unlimited</em> arcs). There are inherent spoilers that cannot be
		avoided when talking about those, so please play those first or read our

		Before we start talking about this story, which is why you should or should
		not play, three things need to be mentioned: the presentation, the engine
		change, and the episodic release.

	</p>
	<p>
		<em>Muv-Luv Unlimited: The Day After’s</em> visuals and sound are basically
		unchanged from <em>Alternative</em>, with a similar art style and the same
		tracks. So, as a recap: the <em>Muv-Luv</em> visuals have their moments and
		are totally serviceable but aren’t anything special, and the soundtrack is
		great, but it can get repetitive after looping for a bit. With this release,
		Anchor rebuilt <i>The Day After</i> in a more modern engine instead of using
		rUGP like in previous releases of <i>Muv-Luv</i>.
	</p>
	<span data-ez-ph-id="709"></span>
	<p>
		If you’re not familiar, rUGP is an eldritch abomination that only works
		properly when you sacrifice your closest relatives and pray to the gods.
		Still, it’s full of options and has a distinct look that has come to define
		the series. With the new engine, it’s incredibly barebones: text looks
		cheap, it’s missing a lot of features, and frankly, it’s frustrating to use
		at times. The engine of a visual novel shouldn’t be thought about, but I
		fought with it a lot. I had issues with full screen, autoplay’s behavior,
		and the arrows that tell you there’s a menu on the side that sticks on the
		screen. That said, ultimately, this doesn’t make a huge impact on how you
		experience the story.

	<p>
		This release of <i>The Day After</i> is broken up into four parts. The
		episodic release by itself doesn’t bother me, but the price is alarming:
		<i>The Day After</i> <i>00</i> costs $15, and the other 3 episodes cost $25
		each. <i>The Day After</i> adds up quickly. Also, to pour salt on the wound,
		<i>The Day After</i> <i>03</i> is not the end of the series; we have at the
		very least <i>The Day After</i> 04<i>/Resonate</i> confirmed, so you can add
		that to the cost. Given that it’s only available digitally and the main
		trilogy only costs $60, this is a lot to ask, especially since the games are
		about 10 hours each. If we’re talking about if <i>The Day After</i> as an
		experience justifies the asking price, it absolutely does, but if you aren’t
		a diehard fan, you might want to wait for a sale.

	<p>
		Regarding evaluating <i>The Day After</i>’s story, the first thing that
		should be mentioned is that <i>The Day After</i> <i>00</i> is a standalone
		work. It has a different cast, tone, and appeal than the other entries. It’s
		an isolated story that spirals within itself, focusing on a tragedy that has
		rocked everyone’s lives. It deals with how people are reeling from the
		disaster but prioritizing surviving in these catastrophic situations.

	</p>
	<span data-ez-ph-id="710"></span>
	<p>
		<i>The Day After</i> <i>00</i> takes place a short while after Operation
		Babylon and follows Will and Lilia and their lives stranded in the carrier
		John F Kennedy. For a majority of <i>00</i>, the general tension between the
		main leads Will and Lilia drives the work, but near the end,
		<i>The Day After</i> <i>00</i> ramps up and provides the action that one has
		come to love Muv-Luv. <i>The Day After</i> <i>00</i> is a pretty
		concentrated dose of Muv-Luv done right, but it’s a small work, both in size
		and tone.
	</p>
	<p>
		As for the rest of <i>The Day After</i> – we get to see how good people
		handle a messed-up world where everything has gone wrong. After
		<em>Alternative V</em> screwed over the planet, the not-so-Emerald anymore
		city of Seattle has become one of the few places where life is sustainable.
		We follow Tatsunami Hibiki in his new life as a leader while trying to
		overcome his past tragedies.

	<p>
		In <i>01,</i> there’s a focus on the politics of the Japanese Seattle and an
		escalation from <i>00</i> in basically every manner. I loved how
		<i>The Day After</i> <i>01</i> engaged with the reader with the
		repercussions of various political circumstances and developed the world in
		fascinating ways. The last hour of <i>01</i> is amazing and my personal
		favorite of the series with genuinely amazing action scenes, as everything
		it does combines in an extremely satisfying way. In <i>02,</i> we get a more
		personal story, diving deep into Hibiki’s past, and he’s forced to confront
		who he is. We see him overcome the conflict between his past and his new
		identity as a hero. It builds an inner conflict between who he is and was
		back then and results in really compelling and engaging storytelling.
		<i>The Day After</i> <i>02</i> acts as a bridge, sowing the seeds of human
		war, but we don’t see most of that action until <i>The Day After</i>
		<i>03</i>, which is primarily focused on that war.
	</p>
	<p>
		<i>The Day After</i> <i>03</i> is probably how one expected
		<i>The Day After</i> to go down – in the main series, there were lots of
		human interests that led to the disaster that was <em>Alternative V</em>,
		and it’s not surprising to see more human meddling fucking over the world
		even more. After a bout of insanity early on in <i>The Day After</i>
		<i>03</i>, it comes down to earth and wraps up the personal story of Hibiki
		itself. We see the results of the relationships that
		<i>The Day After</i> has been building up throughout the work, and there
		were many great character moments as a result.
	</p>
	<span data-ez-ph-id="712"></span>
	<p>
		That being said, while <i>The Day After03</i> wraps up Hibiki’s story, it
		queues up the power struggle in the Japanese government for
		<i>The Day After</i> 04, which is not out yet. Outside of minor nitpicks
		throughout <i>The Day After</i> (<i>The Day After</i> <i>02</i> can be slow
		at times, <i>03</i> gets so insane it can break suspension of disbelief at
		certain moments), the biggest complaint of <i>The Day After</i> is that
		there isn’t more of it. It’s not finished, which is a great thing to say in
		a review of anything, really.

	<p>
		<i>The Day After</i> has a different primary appeal than Alternative and
		embraces it. What makes the main trilogy<em> Muv-Luv</em> so great is how it
		manipulates you as a player and has you on a roller coaster of a ride. While
		worldbuilding was a strength in Alternative, <i>The Day After</i> assumes
		that anyone who sticks around for side stories is primarily here for more
		worldbuilding and politics. After all, if there were a work where exploring
		and fleshing out the world was appreciated, it would be <i>Muv-Luv</i>,
		which has a base premise so interesting that every new entry feels just as
		fresh as the very first one. But that isn’t to say that
		<i>The Day After</i> is any lesser. <i>The Day After</i> has so much
		development, depth, character, world-building, and awesome moments to feel
		way more than just a side story. It’s better than both extra and unlimited,
		and it approaches Alternative in greatness.
	</p>
	<p>
		To add to this, lots of <i>Muv-Luv</i> games vary in quality and tone quite
		a bit, but <i>The Day After</i> has to be one of the most consistent
		<em>Muv-Luv</em> stories out there, in tone and quality. Straight up, if I
		didn’t know anything about<em> Muv-Luv, </em>played both, and were asked
		which was the main entry, going just by quality, I’d have a hard time making
		a decision.

	</p>
	<p>
		Sure, <i>The Day After</i> is the result of the bad end of
		<em>Unlimited,</em> and you might assume that a work that’s continuing from
		a bad end will feel lesser than the main entries, but it never does. We’re
		exploring an effectively non-canon world, but like other works that explore
		bad ends, disaster settings are often the most fascinating and interesting.
		<i>The Day After</i>’s world gets you thinking about different things than
		<em>Alternative</em> and is a more interesting work regarding the politics
		of <em>Muv-Luv.</em> The nature of how war is used as a political tool, the
		politics of immigration, and how we view others from different countries,
		how people manage to survive in an apocalyptic world that’s wiped out a vast
		majority of the human population.
	</p>
	<p>
		<i>Muv-Luv Unlimited</i>: <i>The Day After</i> is an example of Muv-Luv at
		its best, exploring a fascinating scenario while delving into the political
		philosophy of the results and repercussions of everything that happens. The
		narrative has some of the finest worldbuilding of the series while also
		being an epic character-driven story in a traditional sense. It does so much
		right that it’s hard to find any real flaws. If you are a fan of Muv-Luv or
		have just played the main trilogy – I would highly recommend picking up
		<i>The Day After</i>.
