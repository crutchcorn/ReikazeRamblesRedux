		When was the last time you’ve played a game that completely blew you away?
		When I play video games, watch anime, or anything else, I’m always chasing
		that high. A constant search for experiences that take me for a ride and
		never let go. Luckily for me and many <i>Muv-Luv </i>fans, this series is a
		very reliable source for this experience, and age does it again with<i>
			Muv Luv Unlimited: The Day After 01</i
		>.

		My <i>Muv-Luv Unlimited: The Day After </i>impressions will assume that you
		have played through at least the original <i>Muv-Luv</i> (the
		<i>Extra</i> and <i>Unlimited</i> arcs) since there are inherent spoilers
		that cannot be avoided. So please play those first or read our review on
		them before you continue with this one. If you want thoughts on the release
		structure and the new engine, please read or watch
		<i>The Day After 00</i> impressions.

		After Alternative V screwed over the world, the not so Emerald anymore city
		of Seattle has become one of the few places in the world where life is
		sustainable. Along with Hawaii, these are the few places where the Japanese
		government in exile manages to survive. We follow Tatsunami Hibiki as he
		gets accustomed to a new life while trying to overcome his past tragedies.
		In <em>01,</em> we see him get accustomed to a new home of Seattle, a new
		squadron – war dog, new war mates in  Miono Shizuku, and Ellen Aice, and a
		new dynamic in his life – working under Major Jinguuji Marimo and having
		politics thrust into his life.
	</p>
	<p>
		The last bit about politics is significant to your experience of the game –
		by this point, if you’re still following <em>Muv-Luv</em>, you probably love
		world-building and politics, and <i>The Day After </i>understands that. It
		goes
		<a href="https://i.imgur.com/rZMswXn.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
			>OOPS, ALL MUV LUV POLITICS</a
		>
		and does a political deep dive into the precarious state of the Japanese
		empire in Seattle. <i>The Day After 01</i> is at its best when talking about
		nation-building – discussing the problems in the leased areas of Tacoma –
		social to geopolitical to infrastructure. The world of
		<i>The Day After</i> is its strength, so to hear more and more about it is
		always welcome, and to get this through an inherently political lens that
		tries to see events from as many viewpoints as possible is engaging in so
		many ways.

		<i>The Day After 01, </i>for most of the game, is a bit of a slow burn. It’s
		about the same length as <em>00</em> but definitely didn’t feel like it.
		It’s hyperfocused on so many of the details of Japanese Seattle that it
		becomes easy to be overwhelmed by all the details.
		<i>The Day After </i>begins fairly calm, with low tension for most of the
		early part of the game, but then it escalates, and escalates, and escalates
		– ending in a bang.<i> </i>
	</p>
	<span data-ez-ph-id="711"></span>
	<p>
		<i>The Day After 00</i> was a small, closed, isolated, and standalone story
		that spiraled within itself. It was an incredibly introspective work that
		got your mind swirling about the potential repercussions of the setting
		itself. But it ended by opening the can of worms… So how do you top that?
		Bigger, badder, better: ready to strike at you with more PTSD than you can
		imagine. Everything in<i> 01</i> is bigger than in <i>00</i>, the stakes,
		greater, the numbers, larger. The ramifications, huge. The last hour of this
		game is incredible, and there are very few games that can wow you with the
		level of tension and spectacle like Muv-Luv.

		In my eyes, after playing through <i>The Day After 01</i>, I personally
		believe that playing through these games is almost as essential of an
		experience as the main itself. There are very few games that engage with
		politics and as deeply as<i> The Day After </i>and its experiences like the
		end of <i>The Day After 01 </i>that remind me why I started to play visual
		novels in the first place. I’m very thankful there’s still more to come: I’m
		going to continue onto <i>02 </i>and provide my impressions on that, with
		the full review of the entire package when I finish <i>03</i>.
