		War is a cruel mistress, always leaving devastating results and showing up
		when it’s least wanted. You know, when shit’s gone down.
		<i>Muv-Luv</i> Unlimited:<i> The Day After</i> <i>03</i> happens to be
		exactly that scenario; even in the post-apocalypse, we can’t escape war. 
		<i>The Day After</i> <i>03</i> is probably how one expected
		<i>The Day After</i> to go down, having intense drama and wrapping up major
		parts of the story, but it doesn’t wrap the story up.

	<p>
		<i>The Day After</i> <i>03</i> begins with tensions high then eventually
		bursting. Despite Hibiki’s best efforts to end the war, the war machine
		marches forward.  <i>Muv-Luv</i> has an interesting relationship with war:
		while always being a military story, we’ve never actually seen war because
		the enemy was always the BETA. Given that humans have been on the losing
		side against BETA, they did not have time to wage war against each other.
		That said, the post-BETA era was speculated, and war was always on the
		horizon. Alternative V comes as a result of the Americans trying to force
		that post-BETA reality.
	</p>
	<p>
		So, when conflicts are on the rise in <i>Muv-Luv</i>, it’s a special thing.
		While leading to disastrous results, war pushes people to the limits and
		provides some of the most interesting storytelling available. The narrative
		even spends time tying up loose ends from the main trilogy. Sure, we didn’t
		really experience the 12/5 coup in Unlimited, but that doesn’t mean that
		those factions just went away, so it was nice to see them make a return.
		There’s just one problem here <i>–</i> it’s total insanity and can easily
		break your suspension of disbelief or make the story seem more cartoonish
		than it actually is. In a way, <i>The Day After 03</i> is great for doing
		this – it’s dropped any pretenses or normalcy, and in a mad world, you
		expect mad people.

		However, this entire scenario ends up feeling more like fanservice rather
		than an actual war. You can’t keep on escalating in such an aggressive
		fashion and not lose someone in the process. Also, as someone living in
		America in 2021, having a war started by a radical nationalist party feels a
		touch too close to home for my liking.
	</p>
	<span data-ez-ph-id="711"></span>
	<p>
		This is ultimately a minor complaint as the story still manages to be
		absolutely riveting regardless of my comment on it going over-the-top. The
		themes in <i>The Day After</i> lead to some of the coolest moments in the
		series and were incredibly engaging.

	<p>
		When <i>The Day After</i> <i>03</i> eventually does come back down to earth,
		it finishes up Hibiki’s personal story for the most part, which is riveting
		in execution. Sure, the big reveal wasn’t actually a reveal because so much
		of it was foreshadowed, but it was still satisfying to finally see and hear
		after much speculation. There are many great character moments in
		<i>The Day After</i> <i>03</i>, and the depth of the cast is at a climax.
		Ellen, in particular, had amazing moments, which had me loving
		<i>The Day After</i> that much more. This story is the conclusion for
		Hibiki, and experiencing that is incredibly engaging.
	</p>
	<span data-ez-ph-id="710"></span>
	<p>
		Because <i>The Day After 03</i> starts with the tension so high, it can’t
		really ramp it back up in the end, which makes the events feel far more
		muted than the rest. This isn’t bad per se, and the action was compelling,
		but it did feel hollow after more questions arose than answers.
		<i>The Day After</i> <i>03</i> isn’t the end: along with
		<i>Muv-Luv</i> INTEGRATE, <i>Muv-Luv</i> fans also have
		<i>The Day After</i> <em>04/Resonate</em> to look forward to, and hopefully
		with more backstabbing and despair to come. There was tons of political
		foreshadowing here, and the conflict about the power struggles in the
		Japanese government seemingly will go all out in the next chapter. Given
		that <i>The Day After</i> <em>00</em> through <i>The Day After</i>
		<i>03</i> was released all at once, having to wait for
		<i>The Day After</i> 04 is incredibly jarring and is honestly the most
		irritating part of the game.

		/><br />
		<i>The Day After</i> <i>03</i> has some of the best moments in the series.
		Not only is there a war, but the game has some absolutely amazing character
		moments that wrapped up Hibiki’s personal story in a satisfying way. I’m
		left really liking <i>The Day After</i> <i>03</i> overall. Still, a few
		things about <i>03</i> rubbed me the wrong way, the over-escalation of the
		war and the unfortunate cliffhanger thanks to the nature of the release in
		particular. Still recommended and still some of the best <i>Muv-Luv</i>, but
		it leaves <i>The Day After</i> 01 as the best in the series, in my opinion,
		which wasn’t something I was expecting to say.
