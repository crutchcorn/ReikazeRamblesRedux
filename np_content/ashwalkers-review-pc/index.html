		You often run into games that stake their whole structure and appeals on a
		singular mechanic, but sadly, those mechanics aren’t always fun. Developed
		by the studio founded by the co-creator of <em>Life is Strange</em>,
		<i>Ashwalkers</i> is an atmospheric narrative-driven adventure that is
		intriguing in its early moments but the game gets repetitive and dull, very
		quickly.

		Given its name and setting, <i>Ashwalkers</i> made the decision to be
		entirely grayscale. At times this decision pays off as it sets the mood for
		a distinct post-apocalyptic atmosphere. On the other hand, it often makes
		the game look flat and dull, and at times it can make things hard to see –
		like there wasn’t enough contrast. The music is a few tracks of forgettable
		atmospheric pieces, working to set the mood, but nothing that will stick
		with you when you’re done.

		Set in a post-apocalyptic world, where ash is ever-present and conditions
		are cruel,  <i>Ashwalkers</i> is an atmospheric, narrative-driven point and
		click survival adventure but as a result, there isn’t much to the gameplay. 
		<em>Ashwalkers</em> excels at providing the atmosphere and survival aspect,
		but fails at the others: it’s basically mandatory to enjoy world-building as
		that’s really the huge appeal of the style of game and story<em>
			Ashwalkers</em
		>
		is trying to tell. Players control a group of scouts sent from the citadel:
		the dome they call home is crumbling, and the residents of the dome must
		relocate to survive. It helps that the cast is likable, but for the most
		part, <i>Ashwalkers</i> is about exploration. Throughout the missions,
		players learn about how the disaster has shaped the world, and for a
		narrative-driven game, this borderlines on being generic and dull,  but it’s
		serviceable enough.

		A majority of gameplay revolves around survival mechanics and inventory
		management. As you walk through the harsh terrain, you need to manage
		health, hunger, warmth, energy, motivation with a limited amount of items. I
		found the inventory management was implemented in an engaging and compelling
		manner but if you’re not a fan of this feature, then you’ll probably check
		out pretty quickly.

		Players will also need to make choices during gameplay. Each of the scouts
		on your team has a different outlook and perspective on events. Petra, the
		captain, has a strategic outlook; Sinh, a warrior, takes a combative
		approach; Kali, an optimistic researcher, takes the diplomatic approach; and
		Nadir, a veteran scout, errs on the side of caution and isolation. You’ll
		often run into decisions that have to be made with their perspectives that
		shape events throughout your adventure. There are also moments where these
		paths will diverge.

		This mission aims to get to the dome of domes, but a lot happens along the
		way, and the narrative reflects that with branching paths that lead to 34
		different endings. The whole gimmick of Ashwalkers are these endings: each
		run of <em>Ashwalker</em>s lasts about two hours, but to make up for that it
		has all of these different endings. There’s an inherent problem with this
		though: there’s only so many times you can go and play over the same story,
		go to the same places before you get tired of it.

		Additional paths will often converge back into the same places, so there
		isn’t much difference when exploring new routes. While there are three major
		types of endings depending on what location you end up in, most of them are
		simple variations on each other. Many of the endings are a result of your
		last choice.  From a player’s perspective, the only difference between these
		endings is a predictable slideshow ending highlighting the character
		archetype that makes the final choice.

		Early playthroughs provide a decent variation between runs, but after a
		while, the differences were so minor that I eventually gave up attempting
		full runs. There’s no save loading, but you can do a custom run that’ll drop
		you at one of the locations. If I had to play through the whole two hours
		with the same experience only to get a slightly different PowerPoint
		presentation, in the end, I would have lost it.
	</p>
	<p>
		A large part of the game is just walking, so in later runs, I would have
		appreciated having a fast-forward option so I can get to the decisions that
		will change things instead of just walking over the same places over and
		over again. I get that it would have diminished the atmospheric experience a
		bit, but playing through the same game over and over also affects these
		themes. The narrative can be anticlimactic as most of the lore is told
		through collectibles or brief interactions. Still, the atmosphere carries
		most of the weight and supports the situation the characters were in.

	<p>
		<i>Ashwalkers</i> provides a great first impression through its atmosphere
		and mechanics, but each playthrough weighs on that experience. The
		repetitive nature of this adventure simply has you playing until you wear
		yourself out after so many of the different endings are similar to each
		other. These 2-hour game loops had me wishing for longer paths or something
		else because there’s a good foundation here but it’s repetitive nature
		ultimately leaves the adventure unfulfilling.
