		It’s so easy to let our preconceived notions and generalizations shape the
		decisions we make. As a result, though: we can dismiss excellence these
		labels might deter us from. On paper, <em>Genshin Impact</em> seems like a
		free-to-play, Gacha <em>Breath of the Wild</em> clone. Many people might
		overlook it for that, but to think of <em>Genshin Impact</em> like this is
		doing both it and ourselves a great disservice. <em>Genshin Impact</em> is
		too good to ignore. In fact, I’ll come out say that it’s a fun and frenetic
		action-adventure RPG that’s become one of my favorite games this year.

		To begin this review, let’s attack those labels: Gacha game and
		<em>Breath of the Wild</em> clone.<em> Genshin Impact</em> bucks many of the
		negative gacha trends that would deter people from playing the game. I’ve
		never really been a huge fan of the gacha mechanics found in mobile titles
		solely based on their design. In some instances, you’ll feel like missed out
		on events and characters if you don’t put money in, but even if you do, you
		might not pull what you’re looking for.
	</p>

	<p>
		Where <em>Genshin Impact</em> differs is by having gameplay be the primary
		appeal. The griminess of the genre isn’t here, and it feels like a AAA
		adventure. It’s not hard to see the depth that has gone into this gameplay
		loop, which encourages you to keep playing. Like the better gacha games
		available, you don’t hit a wall that limits your experience.
	</p>

	</p>
	<p>
		That being said, the gacha systems are there, and even though they aren’t
		necessary to experience the entire game, they don’t often play fair.  The
		gacha system is composed of characters and weapons. The weapons are the
		fodder that you don’t care about and will be the primarily the bulk of your
		pulls – out of a 10 pull; you’re lucky to get one character.
	</p>
	<span data-ez-ph-id="709"></span>
	<p>
		To acquire a rare character, your odds are pretty low. The 5-star rates are
		0.6%, which is even lower than the industry average. Regardless of the odds,
		the free-to-play characters make it easy to not even think about it.

	<p>
		When <em>Genshin Impact</em> is brought up, one of the first things you will
		hear is that it is a <em>Breath of the Wild</em> clone. For me, a clone of
		what is legitimately one of my favorite games is entirely welcome, but I
		feel like boiling the game down to “BoTW Clone” really doesn’t explain what
		<em>Genshin Impact</em> is. There are absolutely components inspired by
		<em>Breath of the Wild</em>, but it makes enough changes that make it feel
		unique.
	</p>
	<!-- ezoic_video_placeholder-long_content-640x360-999995-clearholder --><!-- ezoic_video_placeholder-long_content-640x360-999995-nonexxxclearxxxblock --><!-- ezoic_video_placeholder-long_content-426x240-999995-clearholder --><!-- ezoic_video_placeholder-long_content-426x240-999995-nonexxxclearxxxblock --><!-- ezoic_video_placeholder-long_content-384x216-999995-clearholder --><!-- ezoic_video_placeholder-long_content-384x216-999995-nonexxxclearxxxblock -->
	<p>
		The primary difference to me is in philosophy –
		<em>Breath of the Wild</em> was all about creativity, about enabling you to
		do whatever you want. If you see a mountain, you can go there. If you want
		to take down enemies in a wacky way, the game allows you to do that with its
		physics system. The shrines involved puzzle-solving skills
		first-and-foremost, which have you accessing new abilities to solve them any
		way you can.  Inherently, <em>BoTW</em> is about crafting your own
		adventure, exploring, and cultivating your own experience.
	</p>
	<p>
		<em>Genshin Impact</em>, on the other hand, feels a lot more like a
		traditional Action RPG and less of a logical adventure extreme. While it
		tries for the same liberating freedom of exploring a large open-world, the
		focus tends to be on combat.
	</p>

	</p>
	<p>
		During gameplay, your team is comprised of 4 party members, each with an
		elemental attribute and weapon. Element mixes have different effects, and
		combining them is the primary way to be effective during exploration and
		encounter. For example, one of my favorite things to do was use whirlwind
		when there was a fire in the way: the result would be your whirlwind would
		become a fire tornado, which hurt enemy Mooks.
	</p>
	<span data-ez-ph-id="711"></span>
	<p>
		Surprisingly, I preferred the combat of <em>Genshin Impact</em> to
		<em>BoTW</em> as it’s more compelling, but <em>BoTW</em> does have higher
		peaks. Also, as elements are the focus, so long as you know what you are
		doing, you don’t need to be super precise with your control inputs, for the
		most part, which enables the mobile versions to be playable.

	<p>
		Another area where <em>Genshin Impact</em> sets itself apart from
		<em>BoTW</em> is the nature of how you interact with the game’s content. 
		There’s a lot to discover as you make your way through this adventure, and
		it seems like more is on the way. However, there’s little to no pressure to
		explore everything and grind levels immediately because there’s always more
		to do. After I got through the honeymoon period and played hours of opening,
		Genshin Impact has become a chill-out game that I invest an hour or two into
		each day, with new adventures found each time I play.
	</p>
	<span data-ez-ph-id="712"></span>
	<p>
		<em>Genshin Impact</em> is designed to be a time sink, and it can drag. In
		the beginning, the exposition drop is a bit overwhelming as the game takes
		the controls away for the opening hours. Personally, I feel like grinding
		the adventure level was when I had the least fun. If I could have talked to
		my past self, I would have said to do that later and do whatever you wanted
		first – you’ll get the experience by doing things and exploring.
	</p>

	<p>
		For me, exploring the map, getting to know the unique world of Teybat was
		the highlight of the game. Teybat has lots of things to see and to do,
		plenty of iconic landmarks and random things to stumble across. For the
		exploration itself, this is where it’s closest to <em>BOTW</em>. You’ll
		notice systems like the stamina bar, climbing, and the way the map grows
		over time. Having the ability to look at your map, set a random destination,
		and explore is incredibly liberating. When it’s combined with the thrilling
		moment-to-moment combat, you’re experiencing the best the adventure has to
		offer.

	<p>
		The last place I think where <em>Genshin Impact</em> significantly differs
		from <em>BoTW</em> is with the story. <em>BoTW</em> is incredibly
		minimalistic in its storytelling because it wants the atmosphere and world
		to tell that story. Still, Genshin<em> Impact</em> isn’t set in a
		post-apocalypse and has its story front in center as a result. The cast is
		prominent, and they keep the game enjoyable and make the world feel lived
		in.
	</p>
	<span data-ez-ph-id="714"></span>
	<p>
		While they aren’t super deep characters, they are all fairly entertaining
		with fun personalities. The narrative revolves around themes within a world,
		about people and their relation with the places they live, and some
		political story beats. It doesn’t stand out and is rather predictable, but
		it’s handled quite well, and it was enough to keep me interested.

		Genshin Impact nails presentation through visuals and sound. The soundtrack
		is subdued but offers enough notable tracks for the adventure. The Japanese
		and English voiced audio tracks are both steller making it though to choose
		which one I wanted to use.

		The world itself featured many great design implementations, with an
		accessible UI. To put it in simpler terms, this game is beautiful. One look
		at the quality anime character designs may turn some players away, but
		there’s no doubt that this world begs to be explored. On a technical level,
		the game is incredibly scalable graphically, with the low settings on mobile
		looking fairly muddy. Still, the high settings on PC looking quite nice, but
		regardless of the device, it always looks like <em>Genshin Impact</em> and
		always looks good, a real testament to its design and the visuals.

		Speaking of mobile, I was also incredibly impressed by how optimized this
		game is. It’s a noticeable downgrade with low render resolution, more pop
		in, and lower resolution assets when playing the handheld device. However,
		outside of those aspects, the game looks comparable, and depending on your
		device, it can run fairly well.
	</p>
	<span data-ez-ph-id="716"></span>
	<p>
		On my iPad Pro 11 2018, it looks great, though the square aspect ratio is
		far less cinematic than the ultrawide screen I used on PC. On my 2-year-old
		OnePlus 6, I ran into issues thanks to thermal throttling, but it looked
		decent when it wasn’t burning up. Still, I’m glad this mobile version
		exists. I’ll definitely keep it installed to play in a pinch.

		None of the problems with the mobile version were inherent problems with the
		PC version. The controls work well, and you’re able to do everything you can
		do in the other versions almost as easily.  It should also run on weaker
		PC’s fine because it’s made for mobile: Right now, I have a Radeon RX 570,
		and it was able to drive 3440×1440 60hz with no problems, even though this
		card really isn’t made for that kind of resolution.
	</p>
	<span data-ez-ph-id="717"></span>
	<p>
		One of my favorite aspects of the game is how it handles your saves. The
		system works on a cloud-server that allows you to pick up wherever you were
		on whatever device you want. I found myself playing on my iPad way more than
		I expected; for this reason, I’d highly recommend you avoid playing it on
		PlayStation since that version is locked to your PSN account, and you can’t
		play it on a different platform, even if you wanted to.

	</p>
	<p>
		During my time with Genshin Impact, I fell in love with it. After only a few
		hours, my thoughts about what this adventure was faded away as it truly
		evolves into a unique experience. There’s a fine level of detail that went
		into crafting this beautiful world, and you can’t help but want to see every
		inch of it. Although the grind and the gachas systems are present, this is a
		game that I will gladly return to again and again. Regardless, all of this
		is available for free, so nothing stops you from finding out for yourself.
