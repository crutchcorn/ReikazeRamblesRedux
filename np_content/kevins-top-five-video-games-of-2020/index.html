		2020’s been a wild ride for everyone, and I’m no exception. Trying to stay
		sane during quarantine, joining Noisy Pixel, going through my last year of
		university, so much has happened, and video games this year has helped me
		get through it all. Ultimately though, while I’ve played and reviewed all
		sorts of games, engaging and compelling story experiences will always be my
		bread and butter, and that’s reflected in the games I’ve played this year.
		Here are my favorite games of 2020!

		<i>A Short Hike</i> is an incredibly charming, picturesque little experience
		that was tightly paced and heartwarming throughout. It was only an hour or
		two long, but every moment was delightful and full of character, a nice and
		pleasant adventure. I’m glad I went through it. The story was remarkably
		moving, an engaging coming of age story that works well with what the game’s
		trying to do.
	</p>
	<p>
		A lot of my love for<i> A Short Hike</i> is a feeling of nostalgia – the
		aesthetic does a lot for me and brings me back to when life was simpler. Its
		low poly look reminds me a lot of the attempts to make 3D games on the DS, a
		system I have many fond memories of as it was the handheld I grew up with.
		When paired with the BoTW-esque gameplay that encourages creating your own
		adventure and finding charm in all the little things in the world, I found
		the game to be delightful and appealed to what I like in games a lot. I also
		adored how the game controlled, as you are a bird able to fly, I felt like
		it was perfect for this game. If I only had an hour to tell you what kind of
		games I’d like, I’d point you here.

	<h3>4.<i> Animal Crossing: New Horizons    </i></h3>

	<p>
		<em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> came at the perfect time, and I know
		that my 2020 would have been much less pleasant without it. Being able to
		customize every little thing on your island until it’s exactly the way you
		want, being able to build a community with critters that have fun
		personalities, having fun with all your friends and family when you couldn’t
		meet in person – it was the perfect time sink that me and many of my friends
		needed. <em>Animal Crossing</em> quickly became one of my most played games
		on Switch, with my playtime clocking in about 175 hours, and I enjoyed a lot
		of it.

	<h3>3. <i>YOU and ME and HER: a love story    </i><i></i></h3>

	<p>
		I really quite enjoyed <i>YOU and ME and HER: a love story</i>, for a lot of
		the reasons that I enjoyed <i>13 Sentinels</i> – it does really interesting
		things with storytelling in video games. The way it handles its plot
		progression, the way it plays with choice – both the illusion of it and the
		actual choices you make is incredibly unique and provided for an incredibly
		memorable experience for the player. It’s a thrilling experience with lots
		of twists and turns, events you could have never predicted, a viscerally
		compelling ride that I’m really glad to play through.

		It’s not quite for everyone, and definitely not for the faint of heart, but
		if this blurb or our review interests you at all, I’d encourage you to give
		<em>YOU and ME and HER: a love story</em> a shot. It’s the kind of Visual
		Novel storytelling that made me love the medium,  the best in the medium has
		to offer.

	<h3>2.<i> 13 Sentinels, Aegis Rim </i></h3>

	</h3>
	<p>
		<i>13 Sentinels</i>, is Video Game storytelling done right, and it’s told in
		ways that only a video game can tell. Telling a massive interweaving story
		from 13 different perspectives worked out a lot better than it has any right
		to, and it was a sight to behold how they unraveled the mystery in the way
		that they did. The presentation is really out of this world too, with every
		moment looking absolutely stunning and picturesque. I found myself entranced
		when playing and was fully immersed in the game – binging through the game
		in less than a week. While on first impression, the gameplay/story split
		would seem to be annoying, but the way they faced each other perfectly fed
		into how my mind works. It made every moment of the game a great time,
		engaged in a way I’m not often in video games, and I really admire it for
		that.

	<h3>1. <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em></h3>

		While I didn’t play<i> Final Fantasy VII</i> when it originally came out on
		PS1, I remember adoring it when playing it on PSP and manages to capture the
		feeling of playing the game for the first time and more. The remake is a
		glow-up of epic proportions; it lives up to all the expectations that we had
		when we were eagerly awaiting the game: full of character, engaging to play,
		and it brings to life the game in ways that we’re only in our imaginations
		before now. The environments are beautiful; the combat is a joy; the
		atmosphere is top-notch. I’ve really enjoyed my time with
		<em>FFVII Remake,</em> and I’m eagerly awaiting the rest of the remake.
	</p>
	<p>
		Also, I love the new song Hollow – every now and then, I’ll find myself
		listening to it on repeat over and over again.
