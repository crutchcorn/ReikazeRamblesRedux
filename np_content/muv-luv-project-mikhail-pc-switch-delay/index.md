Unlike the previous entries in the *Muv-Luv* series, which have been Visual Novels, *Project Mikhail* is an action game where you control a Tactical Surface Fighter Mech to battle the alien BETA. Originally *Project Mikhail* was set to come out on PC and mobile devices in April but is now the team will launch the new game on PC and Switch instead in August.

The cause of the delay is because age is making a variety of changes to the game, introducing a new producer, and during the stream,[ they also showed new gameplay of* Mikhail*.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVn6EyF8-Is)
