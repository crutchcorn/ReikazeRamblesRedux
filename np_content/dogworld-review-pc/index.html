		As a fan of retro video games, it’s always exciting to see new indie games
		inspired by classics. When I saw <em>Dogworld</em>, its stark aesthetic, old
		school Metroidvania gameplay and dog-filled charm drew me in. While I had my
		doubts, thankfully <em>Dogworld</em> turned out to be a well-rounded
		adventure that embraces gaming’s past but stumbles exactly where those
		classic games do.

		The first thing you’ll likely notice with <em>Dogworld </em>is its retro
		presentation. This stark “1-bit” design has black, white, and red,
		comprising the entire world. The visuals give me Undertale vibes while also
		reminding me of the ZX Spectrum aesthetic, which stands out because of how
		unique it is. While I found this design choice appealing, I have two minor
		nitpicks: Given there are so few colors, sometimes it’s tough to spot
		enemies, and I think the character sprites are too large. Locations, bosses,
		and characters look unique and everything combines to create an appealing
		atmosphere.

		The CRT filter is one of the better implementations of the features that
		I’ve seen, but it adds flicker, so you might want to turn it off if that
		bothers you. The doggos are also adorable, and the chiptune music is pretty
		great throughout, adding to the retro feel, getting you excited to play the
		game.

		While you wouldn’t expect it for this kind of game, Dogworld’s story is
		surprisingly well-executed. Set in a post-apocalyptic world where humanity
		lives underground in pods because an AI named Daddy said that the surface
		was uninhabitable, an accident happens where you are launched to that said
		surface. When you climb out of the broken pod, you find out that the surface
		is totally livable, and there are some dogs who can talk.
	</p>
	<span data-ez-ph-id="709"></span>
	<p>
		The game follows these events as you explore this world and work to survive
		against Daddy. Sure it’s not the most complex or in-depth in the world, and
		it’s basically set dressing, but the combination of simple, intriguing and
		compelling is perfect for this kind of game. The dialogue is a delight, and
		the game’s story does a good enough job of keeping you motivated.

		The gameplay is really the star of the show, though. First and foremost,
		<em>Dogworld,</em> in general, gave me huge <em>Cave Story</em> vibes,
		almost to an eerie extent. From the level design to gameplay structure, the
		atmosphere, story vibes, it’s easy to tell that inspiration was drawn from
		<em>Cave Story</em>, but I didn’t mind it since <em>Dogworld </em>does
		enough to add unique gameplay elements.

		<em>Dogworld</em> can be boiled down to a run &#x26; gun 2D Metroidvania
		platformer. You explore a large world and occasionally run into bosses.
		Movement is tight and precise, the jumping is maybe a bit more floaty than
		most would prefer, but I tend to like that. The levels are fairly
		straightforward are still fun to explore.
	</p>

	<p>
		There’s a healthy mix of tight platforming and gunning down enemies
		<em>Contra</em> style in this adventure. You have a large variety of weapons
		but often you’ll find that you’ll typically just use the highest DPS weapon,
		with the rest being more situational. A fundamental mechanic is the slide,
		which gives you a ton of iframes, so it becomes necessary to traverse and
		avoid the enemy’s attacks.
	</p>
	<p>
		<em>Dogworld </em>really nails difficulty. It’s hard to keep a consistent
		difficulty curve, where the game is hard enough to be satisfying but easy
		enough that you don’t get frustrated, and <em>Dogworld</em> manages to
		balance these very well. Bosses, for example, are difficult enough that you
		probably won’t beat them on your first try, but they have fairly simple
		patterns, so once you learn those, you can usually beat them in a few tries.
		This way, you get the feeling of accomplishment that you learned how to beat
		the boss while not hindering your progression.

		The best retro-inspired games are the ones that acknowledge the strengths of
		those titles and, at the same time, add quality-of-life improvements to keep
		up with modern mechanics. <em>Dogworld</em> lacks in this area as it feels
		too much like the games that inspired it.
	</p>
	<p>
		Some might enjoy this, but I found it to be largely annoying. A few of the
		quirks include only being about to shoot in four directions (no diagonals),
		you can’t move on a ladder and shoot at the same time, there is basically no
		weapon that can handle enemies in close range, so you get hit a bunch in
		quick succession, save spots felt incredibly erratic, with some stretches
		going incredibly long without any saves, and a lack of direction. Oftentimes
		I would just be wandering, hoping I was going the right way, and I didn’t
		know I could upgrade weapons until I got walled by a boss and figured it out
		on my own.
	</p>
	<span data-ez-ph-id="712"></span>
	<p>
		All that being said, while these issues never went away, it was easy to put 
		them to the side because <em>Dogworld</em> was incredibly satisfying to play
		in general. From finishing tricky platforming sections to getting through a
		gauntlet of enemies to the awesome bosses, I found myself really enjoying
		the moment-to-moment experience of playing through <em>Dogworld</em>. The
		core gameplay is so engaging, and the atmosphere, the cast were so likable
		that I was never having a bad time playing the game.

	<p>
		Dogworld is a charming retro-inspired 2D Metroidvania that provides a unique
		gameplay experience through its aesthetic, story, and mechanics. However,
		the game suffers from mirroring its retro-inspirations too closely. Still,
		my general first impressions didn’t fail me, and I found a lot to love about
		this quirky adventure.
