		In my eyes, sports manga are a hidden gem of a genre within the manga
		community: while most of them don’t get much attention, they are often
		consistently great series by being effectively better-structured shounen
		than shounen itself. <em>Blue Lock Vol. 1</em> pairs great sports anime with
		an interesting premise for an interesting and engaging opening.

		In<i> Blue Lock</i>, the Japanese National Soccer/football team has been
		feeling the frustration of hitting a wall – while the team has improved
		significantly, often making the world cup, they’re nowhere near close to
		actually contending for it. They have great team players that play
		complementary roles, but they have a glaring weakness in the star position
		of striker. Enter the titular Blue Lock, the brainchild of Jinpachi Ego, a
		program that trains the best 300 up-and-coming strikers in incredibly
		unorthodox ways.
	</p>
	<p>
		We follow Yoichi Isagi, a timid 2nd year whose high school team just lost
		the game that would have gotten them to the national championships. He
		becomes one of the 300 thrown into the Blue Lock program that’s smashed his
		preconceived notions of how soccer should be played: putting the desire to
		win and score ahead of being a team player.<br />

		Volume 1 of <i>Blue Lock</i> is a fascinating opening, and it does an
		incredible job of setting up the setting of Blue Lock itself, introducing
		the cast while being incredibly engaging. Already in the first few chapters
		of <i>Blue Lock </i>the series has made Isagi a likable character who has
		actual challenges and dilemmas, as well as creates bonds with characters
		Bachira in ways that feel natural. Aside from the cast,<i> Blue Lock</i> has
		a Death Game-y style to it which ratchets up tension like nothing else, and
		it’s absolutely a great fit with sports: the competitive nature of soccer
		meshes well with the do-or-die nature of a death game.
	</p>
	<p>
		<i>Blue Lock</i> is unique for sports manga, in the way that it’s focused
		more on training than the actual sport itself. Hell, outside of the cold
		open introduction of Isagi, volume 1 doesn’t even have a soccer game in it.
		This allows you to focus on what really makes the game tick, and the mindset
		of the cast instead of being thrown into the full game and having to learn
		all the rules immediately. As someone who’s not huge into soccer, I think
		this is great and found the structure of <i>Blue Lock</i> is very compelling
		and has you wanting more and more.

		To add to this, <i>Blue Lock</i> is one of the coolest looking, heavily
		stylized sports manga out there: especially in volume one, its aesthetics
		leave a mark. The Blue Lock facility and assets like the introduction name
		tags are stark and striking, the faces and expressions are full of emotion
		and are very expressive, the character designs are distinct and unique. Blue
		look is a great-looking manga and uses its visuals to add to the story and
		engagement of the series itself.

		<i>Blue Lock</i> Vol. 1 is a great introduction to a sports anime with a
		fascinating and unique premise. It’s the start that makes you want to read
		more and is the exact kind of opening to a manga I like to see. It’s an
		engaging read throughout, doing a great job of setting up the characters and
		world while also being full of tension and leaving an impression. Looking
		forward to more.
