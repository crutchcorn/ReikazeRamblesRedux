		We often take our perspective for granted as we assume the way things appear
		is the way they have to be. Sometimes, a change in perspective might be just
		what you need, but other times, it might not do anything at all.
		<em>Superliminal</em> is a game that aims to bend one’s perspective to
		create a unique experience and while it leads to a meaningful gameplay
		difference, the overall experience isn’t anything too memorable in practice.

		<em>Superliminal</em> is all about perspective, and the way it plays with
		this theme is the selling point. During gameplay, you can manipulate
		specific objects, and when you interact with them, the objects’ size becomes
		fixed to how it appears on your screen, and when you place them the physical
		size changes. So, if you pick up a chess piece, you can make it larger by
		putting it far away from you or smaller by placing it nearby.

		<em>Superliminal </em>uses this idea of perspective throughout its puzzle
		gameplay and can feel quite rewarding when it all comes together. Resizing
		an object to knock down walls or making a ramp out of signs are just some of
		the cool ways to progress. I was amazed by how the developer utilized their
		understanding of perspective to create these unique puzzle layouts.

	<p>
		That said, the experience of playing through the puzzles tends to overstay
		its welcome as the solutions never change. The core gameplay of resizing
		objects means you’ll run back and forth in a room or drop items and catch
		them to get the size you want, which becomes rather dull.

	<p>
		Another issue is that too much of the gameplay ends up being trial and error
		as you attempt to find the item you can manipulate because they are not
		clearly marked. If items were a specific color or had some distinguishing
		element instead of your cursor just turning into a hand, the experience
		would be much more pleasant.

		<em>Superliminal’s</em> been exclusive to the Epic Games Store since last
		year, but this updated release on Steam includes developer commentary and a
		Challenge mode. Challenge mode offers the same puzzles with arbitrary
		restrictions, and the developer commentary is what it says on the tin. These
		aren’t enough to justify the purchase if you’ve already played it but are a
		nice inclusion if you haven’t.

	<p>
		I should mention that the perspective tricks of <em>Superliminal </em>aren’t
		just gameplay-related. For example, some textures make hallways look like
		you’re walking to a dead end, but it’s actually the path forward. The
		visuals play with the concept of rasterization, which provided some of the
		more unique gameplay moments as the levels aim to trick you visually.

		As pleasant and charming as the world of <em>Superliminal </em>can be, it
		comes off like a game created from a source engine. Still, the music is
		relaxing, and I’d definitely listen to it outside the game, but it’s mostly
		subdued to the point where it rarely calls attention to itself.
	</p>
	<p>
		While <em>Superliminal</em> forges its own path through its gameplay
		mechanics, its story doesn’t stand out in the slightest. The developers
		seemed to play with a sort of meta-narrative similar to games like Stanley
		Parable, but it’s not incredibly engaging or exciting. The message doesn’t
		really leave an impact, and the story bits are so spread out and disjointed
		that it fails to create a cohesive experience.
	</p>
	<span data-ez-ph-id="710"></span>
	<p>
		It doesn’t help that each level has a different tone. Jumping from a warm
		hotel to a dark horror-themed environment doesn’t make for a cohesive
		message, even if it provides an engaging atmosphere. The overarching message
		of <em>Superliminal</em> didn’t resonate with me at all, and this is without
		mentioning the Achilles heel to the story – the short length, which is about
		3 hours.
	</p>

	<p>
		<em>Superliminal</em> offers unique gameplay elements for a fun evening, but
		the experience won’t leave an impact. Its perspective features turn out to
		be more of a novelty or a practical tech demo than a way to create an
		engaging narrative. While that alone might make it worth giving a try if
		you’re looking for an interesting experience, the idea of
		<em>Superliminal</em> works better on paper than in execution.
