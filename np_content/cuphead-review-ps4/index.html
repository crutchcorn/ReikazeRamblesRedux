		Console exclusivity seems to be a loose term in the video game industry as
		games add additional platforms years after their initial launch. Still, I
		was surprised after hearing about Cuphead’s sudden release on Playstation 4.
		It didn’t feel out of the norm to see the cartoony platformer on Switch for
		on-the-go play, but the PS4 launch came out of nowhere. Cuphead’s venture to
		a new platform only opens the door to those who missed out on the game and
		brought with it the same boss focused gameplay and beautiful design.

		Everything about <em>Cuphead</em> feeds into its aesthetic. The art style
		and presentation always have been and always will be its main appeal; even
		three years later, it looks fantastic. I find it endearing what art
		direction can do for a game and how it works with its overall appeal. The
		1930’s cartoon-inspired art of <em>Cuphead</em> makes it look and feel
		amazing while playing, even watching someone play it provides a sense of
		enjoyment.

		With its run-and-gun mechanics, Cuphead’s story is pretty simple, hitting
		beats similar to the cartoons it is based on. Of course, that’s the point,
		though, and the story has a charm that makes this cartoon world feel all
		that more immersive. The animation of the characters is charming and
		engaging throughout, which ultimately makes it a playable cartoon. The
		designs and music feed into the experience creating an atmosphere of cartoon
		immersion, unlike anything I’ve really played.
	</p>
	<p>
		The cutscenes are ultimately a throwback to childhood. There’re plenty of
		moments where the aesthetic shines, from the environments to the bosses;
		this game is a work of art. A lot of people, myself included, can often get
		obsessed with the technical fidelity of games. Still, those that stand out
		of the crowd graphically are almost always titles with a fantastic art
		style, and <em>Cuphead</em> has one of the best in the business.

		While the core of Cuphead’s gameplay is a run-and-gun platformer similar to
		games like <em>Metal Slug</em>, most of this game is primarily boss
		encounters, which outnumber the actual stages. This stood out to me the most
		because it’s so different than other games. While other titles feature the
		boss as the climax of the level, <em>Cuphead </em>makes them the meat of the
		entire experience. In retrospect, I would have preferred the typical
		platforming section to be the primary gameplay here because they are low
		tension in comparison, and would make the game easier to play for longer
		sessions.

		One thing to keep in mind is that you have limited HP, and the boss cycles
		are quite long, which basically necessitates memorizing bosses’ attack
		cycles and levels to progress. It can be frustrating at times, but this game
		primarily derives satisfaction from both executing your knowledge of boss
		patterns and overcoming the challenges it puts upon you. It’s incredibly
		rewarding to finish any of these bosses, even after your 15th attempt.

		Personally, I wish that there were more difficulty options, and the choices
		offered were more granular. Regular feels NES hard while Simple feels like
		easy mode. Simple makes you fight fewer stages of the boss battle, and the
		stages themselves contain more straight forward patterns. Those patterns are
		my gripe. Personally, Simple’s dumbed-down bosses almost feel like an insult
		to the point in which I can usually beat it on my first try, but I get
		legitimately stuck on regular to the point that I can’t beat them. I wish
		there was an in-between option that blended these two together.

		The controls of <em>Cuphead</em> are a quintessential example of “easy to
		learn, hard to master.” Square shoots your weapon, Triangle dashes, and X
		Jumps. Also, if you press X while in the air, you can parry anything colored
		pink. There are various weapons you can buy from the shop using coins you
		acquire for completing levels. Still, the sparsity of these stages doesn’t
		give you many options to customize your gameplay experience, especially
		early on. If you don’t get the right items, you can basically get punished,
		which makes the boss fights much harder.
	</p>
	<p>
		Outside of doing a double-take over the PlayStation prompts for the various
		buttons, for the most part, this <em>Cuphead </em>experience is just like
		the rest of the platforms. Looks great, and I had no performance issues to
		note on my PS4 Slim.

		<em>Cuphead</em> on PS4 is an excellent port of a fun and unique boss rush
		run-and-gun title. Outside of a few quirks with its difficulty scale,
		everything about this experience is fluid and entertaining. The aesthetic is
		the star of the show, which pair well with the responsive controls and
		captivating soundtrack. You might encounter a few moments of frustration
		after then tenth death to a boss, but the satisfaction of overcoming these
		moments is a great reward. If you haven’t played <em>Cuphead </em>on other
		platforms, then I urge you to play it on PS4.
