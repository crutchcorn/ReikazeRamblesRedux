		I typically don’t follow an indie developer’s career, but I’ve always
		appreciated the games made by InvertMouse due to the consistent charm and
		quality from his releases. Following up on 2019’s <i>Clea</i>, the developer
		has released a sequel with the expected title of <i>Clea 2</i>.
		Aesthetically, this adventure is incredibly similar to the first and even
		trips up in the same areas that the original did. But, for the most part,
		<i>Clea 2</i> is a largely improved experience by refining the mechanics to
		make it actually fun.

		<i>Clea 2</i> is a side-scrolling survival horror game with an emphasis on
		using the atmosphere to create tension. The doll-like aesthetic adds a lot
		to make the game feel eerie, and its emphasis on the story is similar to
		games like <i>Another World </i>or walking sims.

		In this title, instead of the jump scares, you are meant just to feel uneasy
		about the events and how they play out. If getting scared is the main reason
		you play a horror game, <i>Clea 2</i> is probably not for you, but as
		someone who enjoys it when games focus on creating an interesting and
		engaging atmosphere, it worked for me.

		That being said, the side-scrolling aspect throws a monkey wrench into
		presenting an interesting and unique experience by having the gameplay being
		a frustrating and boring experience. When it comes to the original Clea,
		stealth gameplay becomes dull when you need to go to the other side of the
		hallway, and there’s no way around the enemy. To add to this, a lot of
		<i>Clea</i> is wandering aimlessly,  fumbling around until you get some
		results.
	</p>
	<p>
		I had my issues with some of the design choices, from items needed for
		progression being scattered everywhere or the time it took to get around
		enemies. You’re stuck in the mansion the entire first game, emphasizing
		bland textures and character models. As a result, I found that the core
		gameplay loop wasn’t enjoyable – sure, there were engaging moments, but it
		didn’t make up for the generally dull experience. Even with a decent
		narrative, <i>Clea</i>‘s story wasn’t good enough to carry the game.
		Thankfully, its successor improves in a few of these areas, even though it
		may look incredibly similar.

		<i>Clea</i> 2 is a very similar sequel, looking,  and playing the same way
		as the original with returning characters and set pieces but it’s refined in
		a lot of important ways. Take, for instance, The level design. There are
		still corridors of doom, but it’s far more open in general versus the
		back-to-back linear corridors of the first game. That decision means you’re
		not inherently waiting just for the enemy to move, but running around and
		avoiding them instead.

		Other elements have been streamlined, so while you still need to figure out
		where things are, backtracking has been significantly cut down. Puzzles are
		better explained and more engaging but still incredibly basic. The visuals
		have seen a pretty significant upgrade featuring more diversity in the
		scenery, which goes a long way towards making the environments fun to
		explore.

		Early on, I wondered if I was having more fun simply because I was familiar
		with the gameplay vs. the original. Still, the more I played, the more I
		found myself enjoying the gameplay irrespective of skill.  New additions
		like the traps were fun twists that I appreciated. There are definitely
		problems that still linger; of course, minor tweaks can’t completely
		overhaul the awkwardness that is a 2D survival horror, and lots of the game
		is still wandering around. Further, <i>Clea 2</i> just does a great job at
		mitigating the problems to make it more fun and enjoyable.

	<p>
		Of course, as a sequel, the story is a big reason why you’d play the game,
		and I thought <i>Clea 2</i> did a great job in succeeding the first entry in
		this department. The story is simple but enjoyable nonetheless: Hired by the
		Chester family who wants to bring the war maiden into the world of the
		living, our lead is the maid Florina, who works to support the family while
		trying to accomplish her personal goals – remaining regrets from the
		original game.
	</p>
	<span data-ez-ph-id="710"></span>
	<p>
		The main character Florina was a side character in the first game but was
		always the most interesting, in my opinion, and as a lead, she adds intrigue
		to the experience. Like the first entry,  the story is incredibly basic with
		short cutscenes, which leads to it feeling a bit stilted and characters
		coming off like they could use a bit more fleshing out. That said, even if
		it’s nothing new or unique, it’s full of intrigue and charm.

		<i>Clea 2</i> is much improved over the original, mitigating many of the
		deal-breaking issues, and as a result, is much more enjoyable. While better,
		it’s ultimately still very similar, a quirky 2D survival horror with a
		familiar story and weird gameplay, so consider that when deciding on the
		purchase. In the end, <em>Clea 2</em> is a charming and engaging survival
		horror that’ll make for a fun evening and another engaging game from
		InvertMouse.
