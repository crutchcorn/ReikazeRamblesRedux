		><span style="font-weight: 400"

		Immediately, the soundtrack of <em>World’s End Club</em> stood out to me as
		excellent. Each level’s music represents the region well and just compliment
		the adventure to keep you engaged. As an Uchikoshi and Kodaka story-driven
		game, music is essential to the setting and tone of the game, which this
		does incredibly well – moments of tension or other emotions are built up
		just as well as the best Zero Escape or Danganronpa games, soundtrack wise.

		><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Zero Escape</span></i
		><span style="font-weight: 400">

			>As for the story, World’s<i> End Club</i> follows Reycho, a member of the

			trip, which gets cut short after they see a meteor and the group gets
			kidnapped. The group wakes up in an underwater theme park and is forced to
			play the “Fate game,” trying to figure out what’s going on with their
			situation and the world. After the opening moments, the game </span
		><span style="font-weight: 400"
			>eventually transitions into more about exploration throughout japan and
			the repercussions it has on the setting. Story delivery is akin to a
			Saturday morning cartoon, leaving me reasonably mixed on that decision.
			This narrative choice makes it easy to engage with the early moments of
			gameplay, but it comes off as shallow at times with the lack of a serious
			tone.</span

			>Regardless, the story experience is solid thanks to the game’s likable
			cast and entertaining dialogue. The story takes advantage of the setting
			well as it captures the feeling of the adventure. Each new area is
			distinct, making it easy to engage with the levels and the camaraderie
			between the characters allowing the player to feel as if they were a part
			of the gang. I feel like the nature of the Go Getter’s Club inherently
			undermines the strength of the characters, though, as they stand out more
			prominently in small groups, but become cartoonish cliches when they are
			together. Throughout the game, there are meaningful character moments,
			with genuine and engaging scenes of growth, but in the part of the game in

			Uchikoshi games are slow burns, taking a while to truly get into vogue.
			They seldom peak in the middle, and the end is always the best part.
			Obviously, this reflects in the experience one may have with this version

			There are many elements of this game that are done well, and as you play,
