		There was a time that the 3D Platformer genre appeared to be dead, but it
		feels like we’ve hit a bit of a Renaissance in recent years. The newest
		entry in the genre is <i>Tasomachi: Behind the Twilight</i> – a charming
		adventure collectathon made by a single developer, nocras. This happens to
		be a truly beautiful game and succeeds in its goal of presenting this genre
		to the modern era, but it’s marred by technical issues, leaving me feeling
		like it isn’t ready for prime time.

		<i>Tasomachi</i>’s visuals and its world immediately stand out. The art
		direction is striking, and the environments are incredibly unique. The
		levels are inspired by East Asian architecture and are visually stunning,
		especially at night. The general layout makes them fun to explore, which is
		the most appealing part of these games.

		The character designs complement this presentation, but it’s just a shame
		that the only real characters are the protagonist and cats. To add to that,
		the music is well-orchestrated, from composer ujico, and the soundtrack does
		an exceedingly good job at setting the atmosphere of the area you’re in,
		offering the perfect mood as you progress through the levels. The only
		problem is that there aren’t a lot of tracks, and I was wishing for more
		variety about halfway through the game.

		As for the gameplay, <i>Tasomachi</i> stylistically hails from an era of
		games that time has left behind. The 3D platformer collectathon was most
		prevalent in the N64 days with games like<i> Mario 64</i> and<i>
			Banjo Kazooie</i
		>. While not exactly unique, the genre has been out of vogue for so long
		that any new entry is appreciated.
	</p>

	<p>
		<i>Tasomachi</i> focuses on getting you immersed in exploration and
		adventure. The adventure is set in large levels that are dense in detail and
		filled with collectibles. The game encourages you to have a good time
		wandering around without a major time limit so you can properly get to know
		the places you’re visiting. It’s a throwback to a more innocent time, and
		the feeling of wandering around in this world is something I couldn’t help
		but love. It also happens to be why 3D Platformers are one of my favorite
		genres.

		<i>Tasomachi</i>’s collectibles called Sources of the Earth aren’t big
		rewards like stars in<em> Mario 64</em> but are fairly easy to acquire and
		are spread out all across the world like in<em> Mario Odyssey</em>. However,
		these sources felt more rewarding than the moons in <em>Odyssey</em> because
		the reward matched the achievement. For most things, <i>Tasomachi</i>’s
		small reward of a source is satisfying. For big achievements, the source is
		usually paired with something else, like expanding the level or gaining a
		movement mechanic.

		This positive attribute is partially caused by a problem in the game though,
		as you are artificially limited on how you move,  what you can get, and
		where you can go. I understand the latter two since it encourages you to
		come back to levels later. Not having your whole moveset at the beginning,
		though, gives a bad impression because <i>Tasomachi’s</i> beginning isn’t
		the best representation of its finer aspects.
	</p>
	<p>
		Jumping gets you no height, and this action alone causes some simple moves
		to feel tricky. It’s as if you made an entire platformer based on 3D Zelda
		platforming. When you acquire the double-jump and dash,
		<i>Tasomachi</i> really comes into its own and spotlights the depth of
		exploration. Still, I don’t understand why they couldn’t just give you the
		full moveset from the beginning. Sure, the design of the earlier challenge
		sanctuaries wouldn’t have pushed your understanding of the basic mechanics
		as much, but I think I would have just preferred more complex mechanics from
		the get-go.

	</p>
	<p>
		<i>Tasomachi</i> isn’t just by the books, though, as they’ve streamlined the
		gameplay to allow for that emphasis on exploration. There aren’t enemies in
		the game, so your only focus is the platforming and the world. It’s bizarre,
		but the lack of conflict is kind of appreciated as it allows you to slow
		down and admire your surroundings.
	</p>
	<p>
		All the challenge revolves around how you maneuver your character through
		the environmental obstacles. There are three phases of gameplay: The
		open-world section as mentioned earlier, sanctuary areas, and flying on the
		airship. The airship only appears at the end of the game, so it’s
		effectively a nonfactor in the gameplay loop. When fully absorbed,
		<i>Tasomachi</i> is incredibly satisfying.

		The open-world sections are fairly chill, while the sanctuary areas bring an
		intensity that keeps you focused and immersed in the platforming. These
		sacred tree sanctuaries are very well executed. Each room requires you to
		solve a platforming obstacle that is long enough to be challenging but not
		too long to become dull.
	</p>
	<span data-ez-ph-id="712"></span>
	<p>
		On the technical side, <i>Tasomachi</i> is in really rough shape. I’ve had
		this game crash on me about every hour on my desktop, which is likely a
		compatibility issue with AMD graphics. Even if we ignore the crashing,
		<i>Tasomachi</i> is still full of janky moments of gameplay. The airdrop
		action, in particular, stood out to me as being wildly inconsistent and
		awkward. When a platform is moving, you’ll be basically flung across the map
		when you jump. Walking up steps also presents issues as it appears like you
		magically jump up when you’re just walking.

		/>Sadly, the visuals aren’t spared from this. The English text and UI come
		across as extremely cheap. The lighting on the main character is incredibly
		flat at all times, which causes it to stick out like a sore thumb.  The
		character animations are rough: there are basically no animations associated
		with the main character, and she doesn’t blink ever, which genuinely
		bothered me. Further, Even though the worlds are well lived in, there are
		barely any NPCs, making the world feel empty and hollow. All of this adds to
		make the game look soulless. Sure, the world is beautiful, but everything
		other than the buildings needs work.
	</p>
	<span data-ez-ph-id="713"></span>
	<p>
		<i>Tasomachi</i> feels like it’s missing polish and charm. The story and its
		presentation are thoroughly an afterthought, to the point that the
		full-screen effects don’t stretch on an ultrawide monitor. A huge omission
		is that there isn’t a list of the total sources – so you can never see which
		ones you do or do not have. There are basically no settings either, no
		resolution options, no options for windowed, you can select from visual
		prefixes, and that’s about it. The Achilles heel for me is button mapping on
		controllers: they’re awkward, and you can’t remap them. Oftentimes you’ll
		need to jump and the airdrop in quick succession, but the airdrop is mapped
		to Y while jump is A… meaning that you’ll need to claw grip to play.

	<p>
		<i>Tasomachi</i> is an atmospheric 3D platformer collectathon that succeeds
		in the area, but there’s a massive lack of polish, making me feel like it’s
		wasn’t ready to be released. I can see what this experience was aiming for,
		which is said as an accomplishment to the single developer who created it.
		However, a lot of optimization and options need to be added for this
		adventure to be considered finished. Still, it’s possible to have fun and
		overlook the flaws, but they are glaringly apparent by taking a step back.
