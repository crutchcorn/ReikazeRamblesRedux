		I eagerly await every new release of <em>Muv-Luv</em>, but out of all the
		titles Anchor has been releasing,
		<em>Muv Luv Unlimited: The Day After</em> is probably the one I have been
		looking forward to the most. This is partly because it was started by
		Alternative Project but never finished. After all, they went legit. But
		another reason was that I thought that
		<em>Muv Luv Unlimited: The Day After</em> is an exceptionally great part of
		<em>Muv-Luv</em> that no one should miss.

		My <em>Muv-Luv Unlimited: The Day After 00</em> impressions will assume that
		you have played through at least the original <em>Muv-Luv</em> (the
		<em>Extra</em> and <em>Unlimited</em> arcs) since there are inherent
		spoilers that cannot be avoided. So please play those first or read our
		review on them before you continue with this one.

		Unlike most<em> Muv-Luv</em> spinoffs,<em> The Day After</em> is not set in
		the <em>Alternative</em> universe like so many others. It’s effectively a
		sequel to <em>Unlimited</em>, exploring the disaster end that is Alternative
		V. Of the side stories I’ve experienced, I’d argue it’s the best: it has the
		most interesting premise, it matches the tone of the best parts of
		<em>Alternative</em> better than basically anything else, and it’s the most
		in-depth of the side stories in <em>Muv-Luv</em>.

		<em>The Day After 00</em> is pretty short (about 10 hours) and is a
		standalone story, serving as an introduction to the setting. The narrative
		takes place a short while after Operation Babylon and follows Will and Lilia
		and their lives stranded in the carrier John F Kennedy. Surprisingly for a
		<em>Muv-Luv</em> game, there’s actually not that much information about the
		world outside the JFK carrier<em>. </em><em>The Day After 00 </em>acts like
		a character drama or a mystery game where you wait to see what happens to
		learn about the setting as a whole.

	<p>
		For most of the game, the general tension between the main leads Will and
		Lilia is what the story revolves around. They have diametrically opposed
		visions of the situation on how the JFK should be handled. That being said,
		near the end, the pacing ramps up and provides the action that one has come
		to love from the series. This action is presented exceedingly well, feeling
		like a concentrated shot of the best <em>Muv-Luv Alternative</em> has to
		offer… but just a shot – gone in a flash.

		<em>The Day After 00</em> reminds me of many games like
		<em>Zero Escape </em>or <em>Root Double</em> in the way that it manages its
		setting: always letting you know you’re in a dire situation, keeping the
		tension high, and building a foreboding, eerie calm that is utilized to its
		fullest potential. This is ultimately a story about the nature of survival,
		death, and mourning and is handled well: it’s a story about a tragedy that
		has rocked everyone’s lives, and people are reeling from that, but having to
		survive in these catastrophic situations comes first and foremost. I hope
		the rest of <em>The Day After</em> lives up to what<em>
			The Day After 00</em
		>
		has to offer because it’s great.

	<p>
		Regarding the release of this game, two things need to be mentioned. First
		is the engine change: <em>The Day After</em> does not use rUGP like in
		previous releases of<em> Muv-Luv</em>. This change is a mixed bag, as there
		are far fewer options than the previous <em>Muv-Luv</em> games and it has
		some annoyances like you can’t progress text manually when autoplay is on.
		It makes up for it with better support and great scaling, but ultimately
		this change isn’t a big deal and doesn’t make a huge impact on how you
		experience the story, even if it can be an annoyance.

		ez-ai="true"
		ez-dt="ad"
		style="height: 0px !important; width: 0px !important"
	></span>
	<p>
		The second is how <em>The Day After</em> is broken up into four parts. The
		episodic release by itself doesn’t bother me that much, given that this is
		similar to how it was released in Japan, but the price is a bit alarming:
		<em>The Day After 00</em> costs 15 dollars and the other 3 episodes cost 25
		dollars each.<em> The Day After</em> adds up really quickly – $90s for the
		whole package. Given that the main trilogy only costs $60, this is a lot to
		ask for an inherently derivative work.
	</p>
	<p>
		As a<em> Muv-Luv</em> fan, I have no problems paying for this price at
		launch, and from my experience with<em> The Day After 00</em>, it more than
		justifies its asking price. Now, I’ll continue to
		<em>The Day After 01 </em>and provide my impressions on the remaining
		episodes leading up to a full review of the entire package. As of right now,
		<em>The Day After 00 </em>has raised my expectations of the remainder of the
		series, and I’m looking forward to what they have to offer.
